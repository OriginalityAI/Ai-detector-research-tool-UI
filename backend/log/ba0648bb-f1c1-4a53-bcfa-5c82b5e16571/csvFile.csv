"I make it a point to never make the first move.""

""You don't need to,"" he said, leaning in. ""I'll make the first move for you.""

He captured her mouth with his as his arms wrapped around her and pulled her close. His kiss was hard and insistent as his tongue explored her mouth. He broke the kiss and stared down at her.

""I want you,"" he said.

It wasn't a question.  Chapter 15  ""I'm going to take you back to my office and have my way with you,"" he said.

""No,"" she said, pushing him away.

""No?"" he said. ""Why not?""

""I'm not going to let you take advantage of me,"" she said. ""You're my boss.""

""I don't care,"" he said. ""I want you. You want me. Why don't we just give in to what we both want?""

""It's not that simple,"" she said. ""If we do this, it will change things. I don't want things to change between us. I like working for you. I like the way things are.""

""I like working for you too,"" he said. ""But that doesn't mean I'm going to stop wanting you. I'm not going to let you push me away.""

""I don't want to be pushy,"" she said. ""But I don't want this either. We can't just let things happen. We have to make a decision. And I don't think it's a good idea to make a decision like this while we're still working together.""

He stared at her for a long time. She could see the indecision in his eyes.

""Fine,"" he said. ""But we're not going to do anything more than this. We're going to keep things professional between us.""

""I don't want that either,"" she said. ""But I'll try to make it work. Just don't expect anything more from me.""

""I won't,"" he said. ""I promise.""

But she could see the disappointment in his eyes. She knew that he wanted more from her. But she couldn't let herself go that far. Not yet. Not when things were still so new between them.

She wasn't sure what the future held for them, but",gpt-3,ai-generated
"By Mark Dow The opinions expressed are his own.

The euro zone’s debt crisis is now entering a new and dangerous phase. Amid a widening rift between the bloc’s core and periphery, Greece’s woes are prompting a withdrawal of capital from other vulnerable economies and raising the risk of a wider European banking crisis.

Greece’s fiscal problems are not isolated. Ireland and Portugal have already accepted bailouts, and Italy, Spain and Belgium are in danger of following suit. Last week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledged that the euro zone is “in the biggest test of its existence.”

Markets are now expecting a Greek default. The yield on 10-year Greek government bonds jumped to a new euro-era high of 21.1 percent on Tuesday, and the cost of insuring Greek debt against default has risen to a record. The euro’s recent decline against the dollar has added to the pressure on European equities and has put further downward pressure on the euro’s value against other currencies.

Investors are increasingly concerned that Europe’s debt crisis will spread beyond Greece. Last week, stock markets around the world tumbled on concerns that a Greek default would lead to a domino effect, triggering a banking crisis in Portugal, Italy, Spain and Belgium.

The recent wave of market turmoil has highlighted the fragility of the euro zone’s banking system. Euro zone banks are estimated to have exposure of €1.1 trillion to the debt of Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Italy, a sum that is more than three times the bloc’s total banking assets.

If a banking crisis were to erupt in any of these countries, it would have a devastating impact on the euro zone’s economy.

The European Central Bank (ECB) is trying to avert a banking crisis by providing liquidity to the euro zone’s banks. But this measure is not a panacea. If banks are unable to access ECB funds, they will become insolvent, and the ECB’s ability to prevent a banking crisis will be compromised.

The ECB’s decision to provide liquidity to the euro zone’s banks has also led to a sharp increase in the price of government bonds. This is because the ECB is buying government bonds from the markets, thereby pushing down the interest rates on these bonds and increasing the value of these assets in the market.

This policy has had the",gpt-3,ai-generated
"Less than a tenth of companies that have been served with a notice to attend a tax enquiry have challenged the decision, the latest figures reveal.

The figures, published by HMRC, show that between April and June 2018, only 6% of businesses who received a section 20A notice from HMRC challenged the decision.

A section 20A notice, also known as a notice of enquiry, is a formal notice that informs a business that HMRC will be investigating a specific part of their tax affairs.

The figures also reveal that the average amount of tax under enquiry is £377,000, with the overall value of enquiries in the first quarter of 2018-19 totaling £9.9bn.

HMRC’s latest figures show that the average amount of tax under enquiry is £377,000.

In response to the figures, Mark Giddens, head of tax at UHY Hacker Young, said: “We’re seeing a remarkable shift in the relationship between HMRC and companies.

“HMRC is increasingly aggressive about pursuing enquiries and using its powers.

“The tax authority is also less and less likely to listen to companies’ explanations about why an enquiry is unfounded.

“This leaves businesses with few options but to contest an enquiry if they believe it is unjustified.”

The figures come as HMRC publishes its annual report, which shows that the value of tax collected rose by 2.8% in the year to March 2019, totalling £9.9bn.

HMRC has said that the growth is down to its “vigilant” approach to tackling tax evasion and aggressive tax planning.

Commenting on the figures, HMRC chairman David Gauke said: “The more we can get right, the more money we can bring in for the taxpayer.

“We are relentless in our pursuit of those who try to dodge their tax obligations, and our measures are working – we’ve brought in more tax than ever before.”

HMRC has previously said that it will use a “ graduated response ” to tackle tax avoidance, with companies that are found to be engaging in aggressive tax planning facing harsher penalties.

Under the graduated response, companies that are found to be avoiding tax could face a fine, a criminal prosecution, or both.

"One of Obamacare's biggest selling points was that it would bring down the cost of health insurance.

""If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan, period,"" Obama promised. ""No one will take it away, no matter what.""

Not everyone is keeping their plan, as a new report from the American Academy of Actuaries finds that, ""in the short run at least, health insurance coverage will become more expensive for some people.""

According to the report, some customers are already seeing their premiums skyrocket by as much as 100 percent.

""While some consumers will receive subsidies to help them pay the higher premiums, others will feel the full brunt of the increases,"" the report notes. ""The subsidies, while substantial, are not large enough to cover all of the additional costs, and some people will find the net premium unaffordable, despite the subsidies.""

Some consumers will pay more for their insurance and also be forced to purchase plans with more benefits than they need or want, something that was possible before Obamacare.

The report notes that some Americans will be able to afford their insurance, but will be forced to switch to a plan they don't want.

""In addition, many people who are able to purchase coverage on the individual market will find that the plans available to them have increased premiums and fewer benefits,"" the report says. ""This reflects market forces in the marketplace, and it is not due to any actions taken by the Obama Administration.""

The report also finds that, ""over the long run, the net effect of the Affordable Care Act on the cost of health insurance will be positive.""

That's not what the people who voted for Obamacare are hearing.

The report found that, ""increasingly, people are finding it more difficult to afford the coverage they have.""

This is exactly what Obamacare was supposed to prevent.

Obama was promising that people would be able to keep their insurance, but that's not what's happening.

The Affordable Care Act is causing premiums to skyrocket and forcing people to buy plans they don't want.

This is not what Obama promised.

 Obamacare is a disaster. Get it repealed.
