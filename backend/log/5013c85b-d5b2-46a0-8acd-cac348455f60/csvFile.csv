""You don't need to,"" he said, leaning in. ""I'll make the first move for you.""

He captured her mouth with his as his arms wrapped around her and pulled her close. His kiss was hard and insistent as his tongue explored her mouth. He broke the kiss and stared down at her.

""I want you,"" he said.

It wasn't a question.  Chapter 15  ""I'm going to take you back to my office and have my way with you,"" he said.

""No,"" she said, pushing him away.

""No?"" he said. ""Why not?""

""I'm not going to let you take advantage of me,"" she said. ""You're my boss.""

""I don't care,"" he said. ""I want you. You want me. Why don't we just give in to what we both want?""

""It's not that simple,"" she said. ""If we do this, it will change things. I don't want things to change between us. I like working for you. I like the way things are.""

""I like working for you too,"" he said. ""But that doesn't mean I'm going to stop wanting you. I'm not going to let you push me away.""

""I don't want to be pushy,"" she said. ""But I don't want this either. We can't just let things happen. We have to make a decision. And I don't think it's a good idea to make a decision like this while we're still working together.""

He stared at her for a long time. She could see the indecision in his eyes.

""Fine,"" he said. ""But we're not going to do anything more than this. We're going to keep things professional between us.""

""I don't want that either,"" she said. ""But I'll try to make it work. Just don't expect anything more from me.""

""I won't,"" he said. ""I promise.""

But she could see the disappointment in his eyes. She knew that he wanted more from her. But she couldn't let herself go that far. Not yet. Not when things were still so new between them.

"By Mark Dow The opinions expressed are his own.

The euro zone’s debt crisis is now entering a new and dangerous phase. Amid a widening rift between the bloc’s core and periphery, Greece’s woes are prompting a withdrawal of capital from other vulnerable economies and raising the risk of a wider European banking crisis.

Greece’s fiscal problems are not isolated. Ireland and Portugal have already accepted bailouts, and Italy, Spain and Belgium are in danger of following suit. Last week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledged that the euro zone is “in the biggest test of its existence.”

Markets are now expecting a Greek default. The yield on 10-year Greek government bonds jumped to a new euro-era high of 21.1 percent on Tuesday, and the cost of insuring Greek debt against default has risen to a record. The euro’s recent decline against the dollar has added to the pressure on European equities and has put further downward pressure on the euro’s value against other currencies.

Investors are increasingly concerned that Europe’s debt crisis will spread beyond Greece. Last week, stock markets around the world tumbled on concerns that a Greek default would lead to a domino effect, triggering a banking crisis in Portugal, Italy, Spain and Belgium.

The recent wave of market turmoil has highlighted the fragility of the euro zone’s banking system. Euro zone banks are estimated to have exposure of €1.1 trillion to the debt of Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Italy, a sum that is more than three times the bloc’s total banking assets.

If a banking crisis were to erupt in any of these countries, it would have a devastating impact on the euro zone’s economy.

The European Central Bank (ECB) is trying to avert a banking crisis by providing liquidity to the euro zone’s banks. But this measure is not a panacea. If banks are unable to access ECB funds, they will become insolvent, and the ECB’s ability to prevent a banking crisis will be compromised.

The ECB’s decision to provide liquidity to the euro zone’s banks has also led to a sharp increase in the price of government bonds. This is because the ECB is buying government bonds from the markets, thereby pushing down the interest rates on these bonds and increasing the value of these assets in the market.

This policy has had the",gpt-3,ai-generated
"Less than a tenth of companies that have been served with a notice to attend a tax enquiry have challenged the decision, the latest figures reveal.

The figures, published by HMRC, show that between April and June 2018, only 6% of businesses who received a section 20A notice from HMRC challenged the decision.

A section 20A notice, also known as a notice of enquiry, is a formal notice that informs a business that HMRC will be investigating a specific part of their tax affairs.

The figures also reveal that the average amount of tax under enquiry is £377,000, with the overall value of enquiries in the first quarter of 2018-19 totaling £9.9bn.

HMRC’s latest figures show that the average amount of tax under enquiry is £377,000.

In response to the figures, Mark Giddens, head of tax at UHY Hacker Young, said: “We’re seeing a remarkable shift in the relationship between HMRC and companies.

“HMRC is increasingly aggressive about pursuing enquiries and using its powers.

“The tax authority is also less and less likely to listen to companies’ explanations about why an enquiry is unfounded.

“This leaves businesses with few options but to contest an enquiry if they believe it is unjustified.”

The figures come as HMRC publishes its annual report, which shows that the value of tax collected rose by 2.8% in the year to March 2019, totalling £9.9bn.

HMRC has said that the growth is down to its “vigilant” approach to tackling tax evasion and aggressive tax planning.

Commenting on the figures, HMRC chairman David Gauke said: “The more we can get right, the more money we can bring in for the taxpayer.

“We are relentless in our pursuit of those who try to dodge their tax obligations, and our measures are working – we’ve brought in more tax than ever before.”

HMRC has previously said that it will use a “ graduated response ” to tackle tax avoidance, with companies that are found to be engaging in aggressive tax planning facing harsher penalties.

Under the graduated response, companies that are found to be avoiding tax could face a fine, a criminal prosecution, or both.

"One of Obamacare's biggest selling points was that it would bring down the cost of health insurance.

""If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan, period,"" Obama promised. ""No one will take it away, no matter what.""

Not everyone is keeping their plan, as a new report from the American Academy of Actuaries finds that, ""in the short run at least, health insurance coverage will become more expensive for some people.""

According to the report, some customers are already seeing their premiums skyrocket by as much as 100 percent.

""While some consumers will receive subsidies to help them pay the higher premiums, others will feel the full brunt of the increases,"" the report notes. ""The subsidies, while substantial, are not large enough to cover all of the additional costs, and some people will find the net premium unaffordable, despite the subsidies.""

Some consumers will pay more for their insurance and also be forced to purchase plans with more benefits than they need or want, something that was possible before Obamacare.

The report notes that some Americans will be able to afford their insurance, but will be forced to switch to a plan they don't want.

""In addition, many people who are able to purchase coverage on the individual market will find that the plans available to them have increased premiums and fewer benefits,"" the report says. ""This reflects market forces in the marketplace, and it is not due to any actions taken by the Obama Administration.""

The report also finds that, ""over the long run, the net effect of the Affordable Care Act on the cost of health insurance will be positive.""

That's not what the people who voted for Obamacare are hearing.

The report found that, ""increasingly, people are finding it more difficult to afford the coverage they have.""

This is exactly what Obamacare was supposed to prevent.

Obama was promising that people would be able to keep their insurance, but that's not what's happening.

The Affordable Care Act is causing premiums to skyrocket and forcing people to buy plans they don't want.

This is not what Obama promised.

 Obamacare is a disaster. Get it repealed.

"Charlie Barsotti, one of the great cartoonists of our time, passed away a week ago. When I was in high school, his work was in the New Yorker almost every week.

Uber Technologies Inc. has agreed to settle a lawsuit with one of its major investors for $148 million after the two clashed over money-losing bets on an electric-scooter startup.

The settlement with early investor Benchmark Capital was announced quietly on Friday, with a court filing that said the deal would “resolve all outstanding claims” between the two sides.

Benchmark Capital had invested $258 million in Uber in 2013 and was one of the earliest investors in the ride-hailing company. But the two clashed over the company’s investment in electric-scooter startup Lime, with Benchmark Capital urging Uber to sell its stake and focus on its core business.

Uber’s shares fell by as much as 80% after the company announced its decision to sell its stake in Lime in December 2017. The company later said the decision to sell its stake was made in the face of mounting losses and declining ridership.

The settlement will see Benchmark Capital receive $148 million in cash and shares worth about $48 million. The remaining $112 million will be paid out in a series of payments over the next three years.

The settlement comes as Uber continues to face a number of legal challenges. Last month, the company agreed to pay $148 million to settle charges of sexual harassment and gender discrimination at its workforce. And in June, the company agreed to pay $245 million to end a lawsuit accusing it of stealing trade secrets from Google.

The company has also been hit by a string of scandals over the past few months, including the revelation that its former CEO, Travis Kalanick, had been using an app that allowed drivers to track the location of their passengers. Kalanick was forced to step down from his role in June.

This is a very informative article. I would like to know if you have any suggestions on how to get my dog to stop jumping on people.

- A customer from Bakersfield, CA 
There are a few things you can do to try and get your dog to stop jumping on people. First, try to train them using positive reinforcement. This means providing them with treats or petting when they are behaving in a way you want them to. Another thing you can do is try to create a barrier between your dog and people. This could be by installing a fence or by placing furniture between your dog and people. Finally, make sure you keep your dog supervised when they are around people. This way, if they do start to jump on people, you can quickly stop the behavior. Good luck!

"The Ketchikan School Board discussed Wednesday about transgender policies for student athletes, and how such policies need to be uniform for state competitions.

Superintendent Robert Boyle gave an overview of the Alaska School Activities Association’s policy on transgender athletes:

“Whatever each school district has as their individual policies is allowable,” he said. “If a school district has no policy, then the policy is their birth certificate governs the sport that they should play in.”

Ketchikan’s policy on transgender students is inclusive, Boyle said, but other school districts are more restrictive. Because of that, he says, the ASAA policy is problematic.

“There are already multiple district policies, district approaches to this issue,” he said. “And that means that it very clearly will have districts in conflict with each other.”

Boyle asked the School Board for direction. He suggested that the district encourage ASAA to adjust its policy.

The board agreed with Boyle’s assessment of the problem.

“I think it’s a really weak move on behalf of ASAA,” board member Misty Archibald said. “I think it’s a sticky situation that they don’t really want to take a position on. Their job is to regulate activity so that there’s consistency statewide. It’s not going to work the way they’re doling this out. It’s not going to work across all the different communities in our state.”

The board directed Boyle to contact the Association of Alaska School Boards to discuss the issue.

Also Wednesday, the School Board voted to accept the resignation of Board President Michelle O’Brien, approved board goals for the coming school year and approved the purchase of $80,000 worth of Chromebook laptops for Schoenbar Middle School students.

The next Ketchikan School Board meeting is Aug. 24, which also is the first day of school for the fiscal year 2017 school year.",human,human-written
"How to watch Netflix on DStv?

With the new DStv Explora Ultra, subscribers get streaming apps Showmax and Netflix already installed.

The new DStv Explora Ultra allows users to watch Netflix on their TV, making it easier for existing Netflix subscriber or not. It’s the first set-top box in South Africa to allow DStv subscribers to log into Netflix, as well as other streaming apps, including Showmax, Prime Video, and also to allow new Netflix subscribers to sign up, sign into and cancel their Netflix subscription through the decoder.

What to Watch

How to Access Netflix on DStv?

Netflix is a streaming app that you’ll find in the Apps menu on the new DStv Explora Ultra. It’s not a channel on the DStv package as Netflix is one company, with its own catalogue of shows and movies, and DStv is another, separate company.

The partnership between DStv and Netflix has allowed the Netflix app a space on the decoder. This allows DStv subscribers get seamless access to all the shows and movies on Netflix directly from their decoder.

How do I sign into my Netflix account on my Explora Ultra decoder?

If you are an existing Netflix subscriber with an Explora Ultra, the process is quite easy.

All you need to do is hit the APPS button on your Explora Ultra remote, and then sign into Netflix. The same goes for Showmax, which is also accessible through the APPS button on the remote.

How do I sign up for Netflix on my Explora Ultra decoder?

Using the white APPS button on the remote, you go to Netflix and select “sign up”. Once you’ve done this, your Netflix bill will automatically be added to your DStv bill, so you don’t have to make two separate payments.

The existing payment method you use to pay for DStv will be used for paying for Netflix.

How do I add my Netflix bill to my DStv bill?

If you are already a Netflix subscriber, and sign into Netflix on the DStv Explora Ultra, you won’t be able to add Netflix to your DStv account. You will continue being billed for Netflix as you did before you signed into Netflix on your decoder.

The only way to have Netflix added to your DStv bill is to sign up for Netflix as a new user through the Explora Ultra. New users who sign up to Netflix through the DStv Explora Ultra (hit the APPS button on your remote and follow the sign-up instructions) will automatically have their Netflix bill added to their DStv bill.

But if you have a Netflix account that has lapsed and is not currently active, you can reactivate it on the Explora Ultra by selecting “Join now” on the APPS menu (again, hit that handy APPS button on the remote). Enter your existing log-in details and your account will be reactivated, with the bill automatically added to your Explora Ultra remote.

If I sign up to Netflix on the Explora Ultra, can I only watch Netflix on my TV?

No, when you sign up to Netflix on the Explora Ultra, you get the same access to Netflix that you’d get if you signed up on the Netflix website. You will also be able to stream Netflix on a smartphone, tablet or your web browser. The Explora Ultra is just a device on which to stream Netflix like any other device

How much does it cost to watch Netflix on DStv?

It costs the same as what you’d pay for a Netflix subscription if you signed up through the Netflix website. The price of Netflix will be added to your monthly DStv bill. There’s no extra fee for Netflix when you sign up on your Explora.

Do I need the internet to watch Netflix on DStv?

Yes. Netflix is a streaming video service, which means that to watch, you’ll need access to the internet. The Explora Ultra offers built-in WiFi, which means it’s very easy to connect to the internet in your home.

You will ideally want an uncapped connection because of the volume of data consumed when streaming. The recommended speeds of the connection for streaming video are as follows:

A minimum 2Mbps is recommended for SD (Standard Definition) downloads

For SD streaming, a minimum of 4Mbps

For HD (High Definition) streaming, a minimum of 10Mbps (plus connection to an HD capable TV)

For 4K streaming, which Netflix offers, we recommend checking the Netflix website for guidelines (Need a 4K-capable TV)

Also you will also be able to stream shows and movies on streaming service Showmax as well as Catch Up shows on DStv with your Explora Ultra decoder.

Happy viewing everyone",human,human-written
"On Tuesday morning, the Cleveland Browns cleaned house. Again. General manager Michael Lombardi -- gone. CEO Joe Banner -- on his way out. It seemed stunning, even by Browns standards.

Who gives the brass the boot in early February after a coaching search? And why does this seem like an annual tradition?

If you listened closely, wherever you were in this great country, you heard the media and fans cackling in unison. It was like Jimmy Haslam's press conference was a sitcom filmed in front of a live studio audience, or a Chris Rock comedy special.

The Browns were mocked as clowns, a mess of an organization. Cleveland changing coaches and executives like you change your socks. Everyone was having a grand old time yukking it up.

Laugh now, but the joke will be on you later.

Haslam saw a problem. He fixed it. The Browns are much better off. Seriously.

Haslam is an easy target: He buys the team, makes sweeping changes, oddly structures the front office, unsuccessfully targets big-name coaches before settling on Rob Chudzinski, fires Chud less than 365 days later, struggles to find a coach who wants the gig, hires Mike Pettine to coach the team despite Banner's dreams of Dan Quinn, then gets rid of Banner and Lombardi.

Whew. I need a rest after re-reading that.

Such rapid and unrelenting change can signal the lack of a plan or vision -- and maybe that's the case here. Or maybe Jimmy Haslam just hit a home run.

The Lombardi and Banner dynamic wasn't working. TheMMQB.com's Peter King and The Plain Dealer's Mary Kay Cabot have provided some excellent reporting on Cleveland's issues over the past few days, including King's detailing of Greg Schiano's interview with the Browns, which revealed dysfunction and disconnect at the top.

One coaching agent told me on Tuesday, ""Jimmy (Haslam) had one idea. Mike had another. Joe another one. That leads to confusion and chaos. That's what happened with the coaching search in both of the last two years. That's the turn-off."" Or as one rival executive explained to me, ""Mike is a great football guy, but he couldn't get many things he wanted past Joe. It just didn't work. Now, with Ray (Farmer), they are back in business.""

Oh, yes, they are.

Farmer is a highly respected personnel man in the NFL. Well before this promotion, it was clear that he was on the fast track to becoming a general manager somewhere. He's detail-oriented and intelligent, and he will get things done. Haslam said Farmer will have full control of the 53-man roster. That's a big deal. Lombardi, the prior GM, did not enjoy this luxury. Farmer recently had the chance to become the Miami Dolphins' general manager, but he passed to stay in Cleveland. While folks laugh at the Browns, that says something.

Cleveland won four games in 2013. But with the regime changes, a whole bunch of cap space and a ton of talent already on the roster, I think the Browns are in prime position to double their win total in 2014. Again, seriously.

Pettine might not have been the team's first choice, but he's an excellent one. He was a superb assistant at his first two NFL stops (Baltimore Ravens and New York Jets), and he immediately turned around the Buffalo Bills' defense as their coordinator last year. Pettine brings a much-needed blend of savvy, swagger and sensibility to Cleveland's head-coaching position.

I talked to Pettine two weeks ago on my SiriusXM Radio show, ""Schein on Sports,"" and he raved about the Browns' talent on defense. ""We are going to have an attacking-style defense that Cleveland fans will be proud of,"" he said. Given Pettine's history, the Browns' strong pass rushers and Joe Haden's emergence as one of the NFL's best corners, it seems Cleveland's defense is indeed going to rock.

I also loved the choice of Kyle Shanahan for the offensive coordinator position. Executives rave about the young coach's shrewdness in the X's-and-O's sense. And with the impending passing of the Brandon Weeden era, Shanahan will have the opportunity to help define a fresh approach at the quarterback position. Talking to Pettine, it's clear there is no question the Browns will bring in a new QB or two. How great would Kirk Cousins look in a Cleveland uniform, reuniting with Shanahan? Even better, how great would Johnny Manziel look running Shanahan's offense? Say what you want about Mr. Football, but he, along with Pettine and Shanahan, would give the Browns the right attitude and mentality going into Baltimore, Pittsburgh and Cincinnati.

The Browns have two first-round picks and 10 overall in an incredibly deep draft. They have options.

Debate: Most enticing free agent WR? Many notable receivers -- like Jeremy Maclin -- are hitting the open market. Who's the best option? Our analysts debate.

Many notable receivers -- like-- are hitting the open market. Who's the best option? Our analysts debate. READ

And with all that cap room, they can make a splash in free agency, too. How about signing Ben Tate to play running back? That'd fill a gaping hole. And check the list of receivers hitting the open market -- some enticing options there. Do you think Eric Decker or Hakeem Nicks would look good alongside Josh Gordon and Jordan Cameron?

Laughing is healthy. I encourage it. But stop chuckling at Cleveland. Get past the bevy of changes. Look at the result of the perceived insanity.

It's easy to compare this to George Steinbrenner's New York Yankees of the 1980s. But maybe the better comparison is to what happened in the winter of 1995, when ""The Boss"" hired Bob Watson and some guy named Joe Torre. Remember when the back page of the New York Daily News screamed ""Clueless Joe""?

The Browns are actually moving in the right direction. Get past the laughter and think about it.

"Founded in 2014 by futurist and philosopher Zoltan Istvan, the Transhumanist Party is an American non-profit political organization, which advocates the use of non-discriminatory implementations of science and technology to solve a majority of the world’s problems. Despite being in its early stages, the Transhumanist party has been incredibly inspirational for millions of people who are seeking modern, progressive solutions to the challenges we face as a species.

The current leader of the Transhumanist Party, Zoltan Istvan, is running for US president in 2016. At the heart of Zoltan’s platform is a focus on the use of science and technology in the pursuit of immortality. He also promotes free education for all, an end to US military actions abroad, and the implementation of a Universal Basic Income (UBI).

Zoltan’s campaign platform can found here.

Zoltan was kind enough to answer a few questions for Basic Income News, specifically regarding his support for a UBI.

Dawn Howard: You have made UBI part of your 2016 presidential election platform. Can you tell us who you are thinking about appointing as your chief economics advisor? Does he or she have experience designing or implementing UBI pilots?

Zoltan Istvan: A UBI Plan is a huge part of my campaign. As someone who contemplates technology all day long, I am sure that robots are going to take many if not nearly all jobs in the next 10 to 35 years. So we need a way to transition society to being able to happily live in an age where there are no jobs. UBI is the perfect vehicle.

While I have advisors helping me sort out the basics of implementing a basic income, I can’t reveal who might fill the role of implementing that program. But we would draw on experts that have already had some experience in their own nations of doing so.

DH: Several countries including Canada, India and most recently Finland have already tested or are in the process of testing basic income for a small portion of their population. How do you feel about this type of research, and do you think it could work in the US?

ZI: One of the best things to happen to the world in the last few years is having smaller populated nations test out a UBI. It gives the larger nations the evidence they need to confidently implement their own plans one day, and it offers a road map to follow.

DH: Many in the UBI community speak of a “transition” in terms of the timeline between passing legislation and full implementation. In as little or as much detail as you wish, can you tell us what you think this transition would look like?

ZI: I think the transition would probably take five to six years to fulfill from the point legislation passed to everyone having a basic income. While I support a quick transition, we also must be careful not to disturb our national economy too much as this historic process takes place. It would be better to do it slowly, but correctly, rather than force it and lead to a recession, or worse. Capitalism is changing due to technology, and may not even survive 30 years into the future. We must be able to change with it and help the needs of every single citizen out there. But we must also not be hasty.

I remember the moment I figured it might be time to quit watching porn. Half of my Facebook friends were sharing this story, which links out to a bunch of tests that tell you whether the amount of jerking off at a screen you're doing is healthy. The lead image is an empty black leather couch in the middle of a room, facing a dark shiny desk. Sound familiar? If not, good for you. It rang some bells for me.

That couch is the first shot of many a porno. Generally, these videos tend to involve a woman walking in and sitting on the sofa, a seedy guy with a ponytail and big hands pretending to cast her for some photo shoot, her undressing, and the two of them eventually fucking over the desk. The article warned that if you immediately associated that black couch with porn you might have a problem.

I knew I had a problem.

Thing is, my problem wasn't that I was watching porn every day; it's that even if I wanted to I couldn't use my own brain to summon up fantasies. The internet was always right there, the sirens of PornHub singing their sweet song 24/7, lulling me in with their ballads of anal beads, BDSM, and bukkake. So why bother doing all the work myself?

At New Year's Eve, talking about resolutions, my friend Matteo said, ""You know what? I'm going to stop watching porn for a while. I need to detox."" He then told me that Milan—the city where we both live—has one of the highest per capita rates of porn consumption in Europe. The thought that I was contributing to this number—to this faceless army of fervent masturbators—was a uniquely depressing one.

""I'm going to stop, too,"" I said, with all the right intentions. The next day I watched some porn. However, when February rolled around I decided to start my mission in earnest.

I'd been watching porn on a very regular basis, clicking on RedTube or YouPorn or Tube8 most nights before going to sleep, or sometimes during the day if I was bored and felt like giving my wrist a bit of a workout. With that in mind, I assumed it would be hard to just cut myself off cold turkey, but for the first few days it was actually surprisingly easy. The closest thing I can equate it to is quitting smoking; not lighting up becomes a point of honor, a personal challenge, a battle you need to win in order to continue thinking of yourself as a decent human being.

This feeling—for the first couple of days, at least—was more pleasurable than the craving I'd decided to forego. I masturbated as I'd always done, and the novelty of using my mind again was exciting. I fantasized about ex-girlfriends and lovers and the things I'd always wanted to do but had been too shy to suggest. None of this was completely new, of course, but I'd never done it in such a systematic way. Now, every time I wanted to jerk off, I had to create a video of my own: concentrate, add details, flesh it out, give it a chronological order.

Feeling slightly self-righteous, I started to believe that the no-porn month laying ahead of me wasn't going to be so hard after all.

Turns out this confidence was premature.

The first—and most troubling—problem was my imagination. My fantasies quickly became repetitive: the same scenes, same places, same people, same bodies, same sex. I was unable to stretch my inventiveness any further than it had already been stretched. Each time I tried to expand on what I had, I fell back on what I already knew, like an old married couple going through the motions: lights off, missionary, leg cramp, a glass of water, silence.

Ten days into the experiment I stopped masturbating. However, I did still feel the need to orgasm. I'd forced blue balls on myself because I didn't want to undergo the process to achieve the end result. I soon realized—and this might seem quite bleak and obvious, but until you've experienced it firsthand it's hard to empathize with the concept—that using your imagination can be a bit of a chore. A chore I wasn't used to anymore.

I realize how lazy this sounds: a man who literally cannot be bothered to summon up a mental image of a naked woman. But the main problem I had was in synthesizing a sense of desire. I've been masturbating for roughly 15 years, and in this time porn has become a sad surrogate for lust—thousands of videos, most of them blurring into one image of a dick mechanically entering and exiting a vagina, helping me create what was missing. Dejected, I recognized the fact that I had rarely used my mind to orgasm in nearly a decade and a half.

Jesus, that fucking sentence.

Thankfully, this second phase slowly came to an end. The next step was a welcome return of natural desire: For the first time it was about my body, not my head. It was something I hadn't experienced before, or at least couldn't remember experiencing.

Before I quit watching porn, the pattern was as follows:

I felt like jerking off. I went on a porn site. I found a video. I jerked off.

None of the process felt organic, which is probably because it wasn't. The porn was just one step in a tedious, familiar plan, helping me to achieve something I'd already mapped out in my mind. Now it had gone back to some thought or image randomly awaking a sexual desire, me fantasizing about something, and then masturbating. Much better.

I also noticed that, for the first time, I wasn't thinking about anything in particular. Not the French couple, not the threesome in an Ikea-furnished bungalow, not the college orgy—rather about physical sensations and actually being able to appreciate them. It was more similar to sex than any of the many, many times I'd previously jerked off.

I shared my thoughts with a friend. She told me—and it was the most obvious thing in the world to her—that when she masturbated it was rarely to a defined set of images. That it was more about creating a sensation. She also underlined something I'd never noticed before, despite having watched thousands of porn videos throughout my life.

""In 80 percent of porn there are no hands involved,"" she said.

""What do you mean no hands?""

""I mean no hands. Exactly that.""

The need to show penetration and to focus on the woman means that all the acts we associate with good sex—hands, grabbing, hugging, pulling—are eliminated in favor of getting the best angles. Sex without what makes sex great.

After that little lesson, I noticed a substantial improvement in my orgasms. Before I stopped watching porn, as I came there would be a moment when the sensation peaked, before quickly disappearing and leaving little trace. But not any more. Coming lasted for much longer. As it happened, the sensation lingered throughout my body. I felt much more involved.

If, before, I clicked on a video, skipped through it, found a scene I liked, came, and quickly closed the computer to hide my embarrassment, I was now taking my time. That sinister post-masturbatory depression was gone.

A little over a month has passed, and I've decided to continue with the no-porn jerking off policy. I don't know how long I'll last, because you can basically keep anything up for a month without it becoming too much of an issue. It's in the post-honeymoon stage that it starts to become a little more difficult, when the novelty of the challenge wears off and the power of a well-established pattern starts playing on your mind.

I reckon I'll be able to keep on going for a long while yet, but I'm also realistic about how easy it would be to slip back into it. I guess it's like smoking a cigarette after you've quit: The first couple of drags taste awful, but give it a couple more and you'll be hooked once again.",human,human-written

"How Two Creative Teams Are Shaking up Salt

These repeat creators are collaborating on a magazine and design object that celebrate the historical significance of a simple but universal ingredient.

The creators of Salty, a design vessel and magazine celebrating salt.

If your holiday meal planning doesn’t require some creative accommodations for allergies and dietary restrictions, congratulations. But for many of us, these year-end times of coming together also highlight diverse dining habits.

That’s what Kristen Taylor was thinking about when she came up with the idea for Salty, a magazine and design vessel (live on Kickstarter now) that celebrates an ancient and near-universal ingredient: salt.

The Salty project includes a 100-page magazine about how salt is used around the world and a design vessel for your own table-side adventures.

“I’ve been thinking about how we do and don’t eat together as friends and as family. It’s harder because people have so many different diets — you become allergic to something, or you don’t eat gluten, or you’re running a marathon and eat differently for a while. There are all these ways that eating together has become fragmented,” Taylor explains. “So I was looking into the foods that we all need, the ways we need to eat together. And salt is universal. Our bodies need it; our brains need it to function every day.”

Taylor is the creator of the independent print magazine Saucy and an alumna of Al Jazeera, PBS, and the podcast Serial. So she knew she wanted to create a magazine telling the story of salt’s significance around the world—from indigenous eating habits to community salt hotels to family salt production plots (plus lots of recipes). But she also thought her project could have a deeper impact if it included a physical object for readers to use at home.

“I got really obsessed with salt, and I wanted to make it more visible — something that you think about all the time.”

So she called her friends Che-Wei Wang and Taylor Levy.

The husband and wife team behind the design studio CW&T are graduates of NYU’s ITP program, where Taylor used to teach. But the duo really came onto her radar when she backed their Kickstarter project for the Pen Type-A in 2011. “I fell in love with how they think and how they design. I’ve been a superfan ever since.”

Since that first project, CW&T has launched six additional Kickstarter campaigns that solidified the studio’s reputation for making beautiful, long-lasting everyday objects. So Taylor came to them with a salty proposition: she’d research and produce a magazine, and they’d prototype and fabricate the accompanying salt vessel.

“We had never really thought about working in food before,” says Levy. “We make things like pens and timepieces, precision machined and engineered to last multiple generations, to suggest you pay attention to what is otherwise ordinary. Salt is one of those everyday things, but if you look at it closely, it’s really quite extraordinary.”

The salt holder they designed references the nef, a small silver or golden container that was set in front of honored guests at medieval banquets. Salt was so prized at the time that nefs were typically fashioned to look like tiny, ornate replicas of sailing ships, and often featured a secret drawer for the coveted commodity.

CW&T’s take on the nef still references sailing ships, but in a much sleeker shape.

“When Kristen first showed us ancient salt nefs, we were blown away — mostly because we could never imagine something so ornate living on our table. So we iterated a ton,” explains Levy. “The one thing that stayed, in a sense, was the idea of a hidden compartment. To access the salt, you swipe a disc to reveal a hole in a smooth, pill-shaped surface. What you don’t see is that below the surface, the entire body of the vessel is filled with salt.”

The design celebrates salt’s history, but also how it travels around the world—and around the table. “Part of the beauty of the sliding lid is that it has movement in it,” says Taylor. “You pass the vessel at the table. You move it from the kitchen to the table. It’s always moving. And that’s the same thing that we were trying to bring out in the magazine. I went to six different countries and explored how salt moves in our daily lives, but also around the world.”",human,human-written

"But then self-doubt crept in. I started thinking of all the potential readers who would disagree with my post and rage on me in the comments.

First of all, I don’t have a degree in psychology. What if people jumped into the comments and told me I’m not qualified to write about the topic? I had seen it happen with other people’s articles on narcissism, even though I had gained considerable insight and value from what the authors wrote.

Second, there’s a school of thought that says, we should love the narcissists for their flaws, and not speak badly of them. Well, we should also love the victims. Those of us who have experience can save potential victims years of confusion and frustration. Still, though, it was an argument I didn’t care to have in the comments section of a post.

Third, I worried narcissists themselves would get on the comments and rage at me, bash me, even threaten me. By exposing who they are and how they act, I represent a threat to their way of life.

Fourth and finally, I come from the southern U.S. where every discussion seems to turn into a matter of race. Would someone claim I am using a racist term by writing about “White Knight” narcissism (as compared to the classic “Dark Knight” type of narcissist)? I was just using the term coined by the expert, and I certainly never intended it to be racist, but I felt I had to be worried someone would interpret it that way.

How to overcome your self-doubt as a writer

Below are three strategies I used to overcome my fear of criticism. I went on to publish my article on White Knight narcissism, which has become one of my three most successful articles this month.

Your haters don’t know you; to them, you’re just a symbol

Haters, for the most part, are people who are going through life with an ax to grind. They’re going to spew their venom on someone. In this case, it just happened to be your post that supplied the necessary trigger they were seeking. If it hadn’t been you, they would have raged on someone else who unknowingly fueled their fire.

Look. If someone’s exposure to who you are is limited to a 5-minute article they read on a website, they don’t know you. Rather, you symbolize whatever perceived injustice gets them up on their soapbox.

When someone has a vast overreaction to what you have to say, they’re not telling you something about yourself — they’re telling you something about themselves. Specifically, they’re telling you that they don’t deserve even another second of your time, so close their comment without responding, take a moment to cleanse your energy if you feel the need, and move on.

If everybody likes you, you are doing it wrong. — Ben Michaels

What would your writing coach tell you?

What’s that? You don’t have a writing coach? Yeah, me neither. At least not one I can see.

What I’ve learned to do, and what I would advise you to try as well when you encounter resistance when writing, is to imagine your best future writing self 6 to 12 months from now. Imagine the writer who has many published stories and successes under their belt. What would that version of you tell you to do?

Do you really think that future self would tell you, “Naaah, don’t write that, there might be one person out there somewhere who would disagree with what you have to say. You wouldn’t want to offend them.” Of course not! So step into that best future self.

Credit where credit is due: I got the idea to check in with my future writing self from If You Ask Yourself This Question Every Single Day, You’ll Be Ahead of 99% by Sinem Gunel. It’s most definitely worth 4 minutes of your time if you need help getting unstuck.

Write for your biggest fans

Imagine that you have people out there who visit your profile page every day. They’ve come to see if you’ve posted anything new today, because they’re eager to read anything that you, one of their favorite writers, has to say.

What? You don’t have readers like that? Can you prove it?

Several times on this and other platforms, I have been pleasantly surprised to discover I did have those kinds of fans, and didn’t know it.

So why not write for them?

I’ll let you in on a little secret: If you write for those fans, even if you don’t currently have them, you soon will. Your enthusiasm will be contagious and people will want to read more from you. Doesn’t that sound like a better strategy than writing for trolls and haters?

In summary

Writers, like any other kind of human, are subject to bouts of self-doubt and fear of criticism. Not only is it hard to get unwarranted criticism out of your head, but it’s also easy to imagine future unwarranted criticism that can make you question whether you should publish some of your best work. Uncertainty presents the ego-driven mind an opportunity to fill in the blanks with things that could go wrong.

There are strategies, however, to silence the mind. If you worry about unwarranted criticism, realize the critics see you as a symbol and that they are commenting on themselves far more than they are you.

Learn to reach out to your best future self as a writer, to connect with that best version of yourself, and to draw on their wisdom for guidance.

Finally, imagine that you’re writing for your most dedicated fans, even if you think you don’t have any — you may be wrong, and if you don’t currently have such fans, you will soon if you keep expressing your best self.

"One of the most persistent storylines continuing to dog the Dallas Cowboys is the notion of the December swoon. If you've been following the Cowboys headlines over the last couple of years, you'll know that the story has gained an almost mythic quality: as soon as the calendar turns to December, the Cowboys are expected to collapse.

More specifically, the Cowboys' high profile quarterback is expected to collapse come December. By now, you'll know that Tony Romo owns November but has struggled in December - or so you may have been led to believe.

It is true that Tony Romo has done exceptionally well in November. Over his career, he has accumulated a 21-4 record and a 108.5 passer rating in November. But December is a different story, right? One of the more nefarious allegations that live on like the undead in the darkest recesses of a prison compound in Georgia is that Romo sucks in December. Irrefutable fact or vicious slander?

Yesterday, our own KD Drummond pointed out via Twitter that ""Tony Romo has thrown 18 TDs & only 1 pick in his last 8 Dec games (09-current)... but you know what the meme is.""

That made me sit up, because I wasn't aware of that particular stat line. And when Carlos Mendez from the Star-Telegram replied to KD's tweet saying that he was writing a story on that exact topic for today, I decided to set the stat hound loose to sniff out the truth.

As KD pointed out, Romo has played eight full December games since 2009: four in 2009; none in 2010 as he sat out with a broken collarbone; three in 2011 (plus two pass attempts against the Eagles before injuring his throwing hand); and one more last Sunday against the Eagles. Over those 8 games and two pass attempts, Romo has thrown for 2,411 yards, 18 TDs and 1 INT on 201-for-289 passing (69.6%). That gives Romo a passer rating of 114.1 for December from 2009-2012.

Want to know how that compares to the other QBs across the league? Here you go:

December Passer Rating 2009-2012, min. 250 pass attempts QB Passer Rating CMP ATT Yds CMP% YPA TD INT Tony Romo 114.1 201 289 2,411 69.6% 8.3 18 1 Aaron Rodgers 106.1 243 388 3,265 62.6% 8.4 27 6 Tom Brady 105.7 275 425 3,432 64.7% 8.1 28 6 Philip Rivers 101.1 288 435 3,635 66.2% 8.4 23 9 Drew Brees 98.9 385 547 4,113 70.4% 7.5 30 15 Peyton Manning 95.6 214 320 2,324 66.9% 7.3 21 11 Matt Schaub 93.6 228 357 2,797 63.9% 7.8 16 8 Ben Roethlisberger 92.0 226 370 3,122 61.1% 8.4 13 7 Jason Campbell 91.2 160 251 1,890 63.7% 7.5 11 6 Joe Flacco 87.0 206 361 2,473 57.1% 6.9 22 10 Carson Palmer 85.9 275 431 3,147 63.8% 7.3 19 15 Eli Manning 85.6 265 453 3,643 58.5% 8.0 23 17 Matt Ryan 85.5 220 399 2,505 55.1% 6.3 21 6 Alex Smith 83.4 199 336 2,216 59.2% 6.6 12 6 Kyle Orton 76.5 162 278 1,806 58.3% 6.5 9 8 Josh Freeman 74.6 229 389 2,670 58.9% 6.9 14 16 Chad Henne 70.4 215 362 2,217 59.4% 6.1 9 13 Ryan Fitzpatrick 69.5 198 350 2,224 56.6% 6.4 11 14 Matt Hasselbeck 63.8 224 357 2,265 62.7% 6.3 8 21 Mark Sanchez 62.6 201 368 2,106 54.6% 5.7 9 15

Tony Romo has the best quarterback rating of any NFL quarterback in December over the last four years. That's indisputable. And just like we did in our look at QB Trifecta performances yesterday, we once again find the usual suspects (Peyton, Brees, Brady and Rodgers) at the top of the leaderboard - right behind Tony Romo.

The December meme is such a convenient hook that many pundits and fans alike have taken it at face value without giving the matter further thought. But a closer look at the stats shows that as good as Romo has been in November, over the last four years he's been even better in December.

Yet as good as Romo has been - and let's be very clear here: no QB has been better - the Cowboys only managed a paltry 4-4 record in the eight full December games Romo played from 2009-2012. That's pitiful. And it's also a clear illustration that as good as your QB may be, football is still a team game.

And just for perspective, here are some more December records, this time for QBs who had between 100 and 250 pass attempts in December between 2009 and 2012 (and are still on an NFL roster).

In his story for the Star-Telegram, appropriately titled ""Romo strong in December, Cowboys not so much"", Mendez quotes Tony Romo:

""Statistics? It's about winning and losing,"" Romo said. ""Stats are just there for people to talk about. I understand that. My team does. As long as we keep winning, that's a good sign.""

So let's talk about it: The Cowboys have four more games left in December this year. They are entering those four games with a QB who has outperformed every other NFL QB down the stretch over the last four years - and that includes future HoF locks like Manning, Rodgers and Brady, as well as Dilfer-type Super Bowl winners like Roethlisberger and Eli Manning - but will it be enough?

Can and will the rest of the Cowboys play up to Romo's standards?",human,human-written

It's hard to convey the excitement and performance of a supercar with a piece of furniture, but John & Table has tried.
The company's Race table is made of carbon fiber, and trimmed in leather and Alcantara. So it does have something in common with quite a few high-end performance cars.
It also features a price tag worthy of a Lamborghini. The Race costs 38,800 euros, or about $52,209 at current exchange rates and--unlike an Aventador--it probably won't offer much more performance than its mainstream counterpart.
Granted, each table is custom-built in Germany to individual specifications. Perhaps it's a similar process to being measured and fitted for a custom race seat, or maybe John & Table just asks measurements of the room.
Then there's all that carbon fiber. The entire table top is made of it, which John & Table says eliminates the need for a center beam. If moving truck racing ever takes off, the teams will probably want to get a few of these.
John & Table carbon fiber office furnitureJohn & Table also offers a race-inspired carbon fiber office chair to go with its creation (also available in Sterling silver and 24-karat gold), but why stop there?
If one high-performance table isn't enough, there's always the Lamborghini desk from Polish manufacturer RETRO that looks like the front end of a Murcielago, or the one from Bugatti that looks like a robot. They might clash with your Ferrari desk chairs, though.
Soon, it just might be possible to furnish an entire house with car-themed items. That would be the fastest house on the block.

"NBA norms have been upended like virtually everything else this pandemic-plagued year. The 2020-21 NBA season is set to start Dec. 22, just two months after the conclusion of the interrupted 2019-20 season.



The number of games will be reduced again—the league is aiming for a 72-game season running through May 16—but teams will return to playing in their home arenas (and receive daily COVID-19 testing), with the exception of the Toronto Raptors, who will play indefinitely in Tampa, FL, due to Canada’s COVID-19 restrictions.



Updated December 16, 2020 to report all your streaming options for the 2020-21 NBA season.



Although there has been talk of teams allowing some fans back in the stands, the safest place to view games this season if from your own home. Fortunately, there are plenty of options for cable cutters to stream games. As in the past, big matchups will be broadcast nationally on ABC, ESPN/ESPN2, TNT, and NBA TV; you can get most, if not all, of these covered with a single streaming package.



Unfortunately, the same can’t be said for the regional sports networks (RSNs) that air the bulk of teams’ games. Fox Sports, NBC Sports, YES Network, Marquee Sports Network, and other RSNs have been dropped from YouTube TV, Hulu With Live TV, Sling TV, and fuboTV, because of disputes with providers. If you’re mainly interested in following your local team through the season, your best bet is to determine which streaming service has an agreement with your team’s regional network and go with that one. Chances are it will also stream some or all of the cable networks mentioned above. A few teams can still be found on over-the-air channels—the Chicago Bulls on the windy city’s WGN, for one—but that arrangement is rapidly going the way of the two-handed set shot.



Over the air Martyn Williams/IDG Winegard’s Flatwave Amped antenna (model number FL-5500A) is one of our favorite indoor antennas.



The good news is you can access ABC for free if you have an over-the-air TV antenna (you’ll find our top antenna picks here) and are within the radius of a local ABC affiliate’s broadcast tower. The bad news is the network is scheduled to air only 10 of this year’s nationally televised games. These, however, include some of the league’s marquee matchups, including three Christmas Day games: Warriors vs. Bucks, Nets vs. Celtics, and Mavericks vs. Lakers.



You can watch the remaining games with some combination of the following services.



Sling TVThe easiest way to catch many of the cable telecasts is with the Sling TV streaming service, but you’ll need to pony up for a monthly subscription. For $30 per month, Sling’s Orange package will get you ESPN/ESPN 2 and TNT. With a digital antenna to catch the ABC broadcasts, that leaves only the NBA TV games to account for.



AT&T TV NowYou can also get ABC, ESPN, ESPN2 and TNT with AT&T TV Now. All you need is the basic Plus package for $55 per month. But upgrading to the $80-per-month Max package will get you those networks as well as a host of regional sports networks including NBC Sports, YES Network, MSG Network, and Fox Sports.



Hulu with Live TV and YouTube TVBoth Hulu with Live TV and YouTube TV give you access to ABC, ESPN/ESPN2, and TNT, though as with other services, the exact channel lineup varies by market. But only YouTube TV offers NBA TV, making its slightly higher monthly price—$65 per month compared to Hulu with Live TV’s $55 subscription—worth the expense for hoops fans. With only the one channel package, though, you don’t get the customizability of Sling TV or AT&T TV Now, so keep that in mind if you plan to use your subscription beyond basketball season.



Jared Newman / TechHive YouTube TV uses a small number of menu sections to make navigation easier.



FuboTVFuboTV recently added ABC and the ESPN channels to both its Family and Elite bundles. Unfortunately, it also dropped TNT, and earlier in the year, Fox Regional Sports networks. If you’re a fan of the Kings, Warriors, Lakers, or Clippers, you might want to opt for the $80-per-month Elite package as it also includes regional networks NBC Sports Bay Area and NBC Sports California. You can add NBA TV by purchasing the Sports Plus add-on for an extra $11 per month.



FuboTV Fubo has lots of appeal to sports fans, and it includes NBA TV. But your subscription won’t give you access to ABC, TNT, or ESPN.



NBA League PassIf you’re truly hardcore for the hardwood, you should consider a subscription to NBA League Pass, the league’s official streaming service. For $200 a year or $29 per month, you can watch every live out-of-market game that isn’t being broadcast nationally on one of the four networks we’ve mentioned.



A League Pass subscription allows you to watch up to four games at once in HD, and it works on computers, tablets, smartphones, and streaming devices. Games originally broadcast on ESPN, TNT, and ABC are available 24 hours after completion in the video archives. You also get anytime access to a curated selection of “classic” games.



For $250 a year or $40 per month, you can upgrade to NBA League Pass Premium, which adds an in-arena stream during game breaks.



NBA Media Ventures, LLC. With an NBA League Pass subscription, you can stream live out-of-market games to your TV, computer, or mobile device.



NBA Team PassTwo bills is a big investment if you only want to follow your favorite team. NBA Team Pass is one less-expensive alternative. For $120 a year or $18 per month, you get access to all your squad’s local broadcasts for both home and away games.



The rub is that NBA blackout rules still apply. If you live in your team’s “home” market—a Warriors fan residing in the Bay Area, for example—you still won’t be able to watch their games even with a Team Pass subscription (this goes for League Pass as well). Your team’s home market, however, isn’t necessarily defined by your town’s city limits.



In the NBA’s own words, the league determines blackout zones “using zip code (if watching via a satellite television provider), a combination of zip code and cable system distribution territory (if watching via a cable television provider), or by the IP address associated with your internet connection or your mobile device’s GPS coordinates.”



What that means is this isn’t a cord-cutting option for everyone. The only way to be sure of your situation is to enter your zip code in the Blackout Notice in the middle of this page before you sign up for one of the NBA subscriptions.



NBA streaming is still 50-50 ballStreaming live NBA games continues to be a mixed bag for cord-cutters. The availability of national broadcasts through streaming services gives you a courtside seat for some of the biggest matchups of the season. But local fanbases who want to follow their team continue to be left on the bench, for the most part. Until streaming options for regional sports networks become more widely available, you might want to dust off your radio.
