"Over the past few months, significant advancements have been made in Counterparty's code refactoring, testing, and dependency management. These developments contribute to the ease of creating alternative Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) and light wallets, solidifying Counterparty as the premier framework for Bitcoin 2.0 application development. In addition, these enhancements enable third-party developers to construct their wallet versions effortlessly through our updated API while providing end users with a stable, user-friendly desktop wallet.

On Wednesday, the debut beta version of the wallet, counterparty-gui, was publicly released, with a more polished interface soon to follow. This desktop wallet can be utilized with a local Counterparty server and blockchain or trustlessly with a light wallet and a remote server, as mentioned in our previous update.

The GUI, equipped with a standalone installer for Windows and an imminent MacOS installer, will operate in 'light' mode by default. Consequently, users will no longer need to run local instances of Bitcoin/Counterparty clients or download the blockchain to commence their work. To access the files, navigate to counterparty-gui releases on GitHub.

The desktop wallet was constructed with both the requirements of end users and the demands of third-party developers in mind, resulting in a fully open wallet that includes essential API methods for simplified development of alternative Counterparty wallets. Furthermore, the wallet is expandable, allowing for the integration of plugins written in QML/JavaScript and, eventually, HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

Future steps for GUI development include adding unit tests in counterparty-lib for all Remote Procedure Call (RPC) operations, placing all RPC calls in a separate process, and ensuring that the BIP32 wallet is compatible with Counterwallet. As always, progress and new version releases will be communicated promptly.

"Rated 4.5 out of 5 by 23 reviewers. 
  Rated 5 out of 5 out of 8Bit  I have her 3 ferrets and he has 2 corner  boxes in their cages. Eventually they started pooping next to it instead of pooping. I stressed that I was investigating. I found my toilet too small. So I bought this  and everything changed! No more accidents outside  the box! I  have a ferret who loves to ""move around"" in his cage. So I bought Velcro and on 02/04/2016 another problem was solved  
 
 Rated 5 out of 5 by luvmypetkids. This is the  best of all Recycle Bins. Large enough for a ferret to fully enter and return to a high wall. The size, shape, and weight of the pot, including the litter (I use Marshall paper pellets) discourage the ferret from tipping or moving it. There is also a hiding place for toys in the back! Great quality, construction and easy care. And the best prices are on F&S!!! Oct 12, 2015 
 
 Rated 5 out of 5 stars by ChristyCal. My ferret had an accident with a corner pan. I was very frustrated with this. The delivery was quick and the packaging was solid. I  received a magazine catalog with my order. I really like this and  will order again from now on",paraphrase,ai-generated

Many people, particularly women in relationships with men, have expressed their desire to open up their relationships but are often fearful of broaching the subject with their partners. It is important to have open communication about such matters within a relationship because if it cannot handle a conversation about non-monogamy, then there may be deeper issues present.

Talking openly about what you want in bed is crucial, even if it involves including other partners. Ultimately, exploring the possibility of a non-monogamous relationship and then deciding against it still provides clarity and eliminates the feeling of wondering ""what if.""

To make this conversation a smooth and productive experience, follow these tips:

1. Focus on yourself, not your partner. Emphasize that wanting a non-monogamous relationship is about your needs and who you are, rather than what your partner is lacking. Just like monogamous relationships, some people are better suited for this type of relationship than others.

2. Be honest about your desires. If there is something specific you are looking for outside of your primary relationship, be upfront about it. Honesty is the cornerstone of ethical non-monogamy, and being truthful contributes to genuine intimacy.

3. Be accommodating to your partner's boundaries. Initially, your partner may be overly cautious and have strict rules in place. However, respecting those boundaries shows that your relationship is more important than your individual desires. Over time, your partner may become more comfortable and ease those restrictions.

4. Practice patience throughout the entire process of exploring non-monogamy, from the initial conversation to handling jealousy and misunderstandings. Be prepared for a challenging journey, but with time, effort, and compassion, things will become easier.

Having an honest and open conversation about non-monogamy can lead to greater understanding and closeness within a relationship. By approaching the topic with patience, respect, and care, couples can navigate their desires and develop stronger emotional connections.",gpt-4,ai-generated
"Newcastle United are set to continue their game of brinkmanship with Liverpool in regards to a possible transfer for Andy Carroll. Alan Pardew, manager of Newcastle, expressed that he would want the striker to be in his squad, but that the deal was not down to him. He also stated that although a move for Carroll is not as likely at the moment, he did not rule out the possibility of it still happening. 

Pardew is concentrating on the Europa League qualifiers and expressed his desire to win something with the team he has. He also suggested that the best route for the club to grow would be to qualify for the Champions League. With this in mind, he has been attempting to strengthen the squad with signings such as Mathieu Debuchy and Douglas. 

Despite the focus on improving the team, Pardew is also keen to retain the current key players, such as Cheik Tiote, Fabricio Coloccini and Yohan Cabaye.

"Winter is coming, and with it comes hazardous driving conditions. It's essential to exercise safe driving habits to avoid accidents and ensure the safety of yourself and other motorists. It's crucial to create visibility in all directions by clearing snow off your vehicle before hitting the road. This includes ensuring that the windshield and windows are free of any fog or ice, which can significantly reduce visibility, thus leading to traffic hazards. If visibility is compromised due to inadequate cleaning of the vehicle, the OPP may lay Highway Traffic Act charges.

As a driver, there are a few simple things that you can do to lower the risk of a collision during winter. Firstly, give yourself extra time to reach your destination; as traffic will be slower than usual. Before hitting the road, ensure that you have completely cleared the snow and ice off your vehicle to allow for a clear view of the roadway. This includes clearing the headlights and taillights to avoid accidents due to restricted visibility. Keep a check on your windshield wiper fluid levels and keep an extra container in the car.

Moreover, while driving, reduce the risk of collisions by driving according to the road and weather conditions. It is essential to reduce your speed and increase your following distance to ensure you have enough time to stop safely in case of any emergency. Speeding is the most common reason for winter collisions. Accelerate slowly, and brake sooner to avoid spinouts, especially at intersections. It is advisable to check the weather forecast and avoid driving on hazardous roads.

Lastly, avoid driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Be responsible while driving in winter conditions and Arrive Alive. You may visit the Ontario Ministry of Transportation website at ontario.ca/511, Twitter @511Ontario or call 511 for traveller's information. This provides you with winter road conditions, construction reports, road closures, traffic reports, traffic cameras, and interactive mapping. Remember, safety should always be your priority while driving in the winter weather.",chatgpt,ai-generated
"Alberta's government is cracking down on lending companies and  so-called ""extortion"" practices. 
 The new legislation means Alberta will move from one of the highest interest rates in the country to one of the lowest. 
 Currently, payday loan companies in this state can charge $23 per $100 loan. 
  The proposed law to stop predatory lending will lower the fee to $15 and give customers  at least 42 days to get their money back  before  interest starts accumulating. 
  Alberta Services Minister Stephanie McLean said the law would best help low-income Albertans. 
 ""Currently lenders are able to charge very high interest rates to Albertans who are the least able to afford it,"" McLean said in the legislature Thursday.

 ""This bill will reduce the high cost of borrowing for payday loans and help ensure that alternative financial assistance and short term credit options are available to all Albertans."" 
 
 Experts say payday loan customers are often the working poor. The annual percentage rate on some of these loans can work out to 600 per cent. 
  Officials say the bill could bring that rate down to a range of 88 to 130 per cent.  Jeff Loomis of Momentum, an organization that works with low-income Calgary residents, said another proposed change that would allow borrowers to pay off their loans in installments would go a long way.

"On Wednesday, a series of horrific attacks in Iraq's capital, Baghdad, targeted Shiites and claimed the lives of over 90 people. The Sunni extremist group, ISIS, took responsibility for the bombings.

The first attack occurred when a car bomb detonated at a crowded market in Baghdad. The bombing claimed at least 64 lives and left 87 others wounded in the largely Shiite neighborhood of Sadr City. The attack left a chaotic scene with hundreds of people gathering at the site of the explosion. The aftermath showcased blood-stained streets, blown-out car windows and a charred sidewalk.

Later in the day, a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest detonated in a busy square in the Shiite neighborhood of al-Kadhimiya. This attack took 17 lives and injured 43 others, as reported by two Baghdad police officials. A third attack targeted a checkpoint manned by Shiites in the Sunni neighborhood of al-Jamia in western Baghdad. A suicide car bomber triggered the blast which claimed 12 lives and left 31 others injured.

The attacks have shaken Baghdad and the rest of Iraq. Such brazen and brutal attacks have become more frequent since Iraqi forces, backed by the US-led coalition, retook the city of Mosul from ISIS. The country is already dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, a weakened economy, and simmering political divisions. The attacks add to the woes of the Iraqi people.

The Iraqi Prime Minister, Mustafa al-Kadhimi, condemned the attacks and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. The UN also expressed its condolences to the families of the victims and urged the government to ensure the protection of civilians.

Meanwhile, ISIS has continued to pose a significant threat despite losing the territories that once formed its so-called caliphate. The group remains a formidable force that is capable of causing large-scale damage and destruction. The recent bombings remind us of the urgent need to tackle the root causes of terrorism and extremism, and to work towards fostering peace, stability and tolerance in the region.",chatgpt,ai-generated

"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Catholics in Sudbury Claim Winter Storm a Sign from God against Pro-Abortion Extremism

Sudbury, ON, December 21, 2012 – Faithful Catholics in Sudbury are praising divine intervention in their campaign against pro-abortion ""extremist"" Justin Trudeau. A winter storm caused school buses to be cancelled, leading to significantly fewer people in attendance at St. Charles College High School, where the Liberal Leadership hopeful had been planning to address students.

The board had originally hoped to pack the school's amphitheater with around 1000 students, who would hear Trudeau's views at first hand. However, due to the winter storm, fewer than 100 people were in attendance.

Protestors who were campaigning to prevent Trudeau's visit to the school praised God for limiting his attendance to only around 100 people. Kevin Murphy, a Catholic ratepayer and one of the protestors who stood outside the Board's office and St. Charles College for four days, commented, ""God is good. He spared 900 Catholic youth from being potentially influenced by Justin's immoral views in support of abortion and homosexual marriage.”

One of the organizers of the protest, Suresh Dominic, a spokesperson for Campaign Life Catholics, a division of Campaign Life Coalition, expressed their disapproval of the Board's decision to allow Trudeau to speak at the school, but thanked the weather for limiting his exposure. The board had claimed that Justin would not speak on abortion or homosexuality, but Murphy believes that even allowing a politician who has spoken publicly against Catholic teachings to speak before a Catholic audience is tantamount to supporting their views.

Whilst the uproar and protests ensured that only a handful of students heard Justin speak, a news release from Campaign Life Catholics mocked the difficulty faced by the politician in speaking before the coldest day in Sudbury since 1993 as ""an act of God."" They claimed that their relentless campaign had succeeded in dissuading many from attending Trudeau's speech and undermining his credibility amongst Catholics. Thus, they contended it was only a matter of time before Catholics became “fed up” with politicians who claimed to be Catholic but stood against the teachings of the church.

Although Trudeau still spoke to the few present at the school, the reduced numbers would have been a disappointment to his supporters in Sudbury. However, the weather meant that his comments may have been missed by most Sudburians. Regardless of the irony of the situation, the controversy over the politician's speech has led to increased public discussion on whether politicians should be invited to speak at private schools and whether school authorities should have the power to decide who speaks on their premises, regardless of the audience.",chatgpt,ai-generated

"The NFL free agency is all about value. Teams try to identify players who will produce more value than their contractual demands suggest. It means finding players who are better than everybody else realizes. This is why successful organizations take advantage of the opportunity provided by free agency to acquire potential stars. Good general managers find players that fit their team's holes before signing them at a market price below their true value.

On the other hand, the job of an agent is diametrically opposed to that of a general manager. Agents' main job is to make the players they represent look as valuable as possible. They create the best possible context for their player and create demand. They convince the general managers that the player they're trying to sign is worth more than their valuation.

As part of the NFL's free agency preview, we will approach the market from an agent's perspective. These agents prepare similar sorts of packets for their players. Similarly, we will prepare abbreviated ""books"" for five of the NFL's most interesting restricted and unrestricted free agents.

Today, we start with explosive Steelers wideout Mike Wallace. Here, we go in-depth into why Wallace deserves to be considered the most promising young receiver in all of football.

Wallace has accomplished more than any other young wide receiver in recent memory, despite unfavorable conditions, regular absences from his starting quarterback, and the presence of two of the league's most decorated wide receivers ahead of him. During Wallace's first three years in the league, he's gained 3,206 receiving yards, which is the second-most accrued during a player's first three seasons, behind only Anquan Boldin.

Wallace's performance during his first three seasons compares favorably to stars like Calvin Johnson, Andre Johnson, and Roddy White over the first three years in their respective careers. He's scored 24 touchdowns in his first three seasons, more than any other receiver in football besides Braylon Edwards.

However, there are reasons to think that Wallace's statistics might understate his true level of performance. While Wallace has made it through every contest in his 48-game career without missing a game, his quarterback Ben Roethlisberger has missed several due to injury. Together, those injuries mean that Wallace has had to play just under 17 percent of his career with a backup quarterback under center.

Furthermore, during Wallace's tenure with the Steelers, he's been part of a team that's played at a very slow pace. In fact, Pittsburgh's offense only ran 165 possessions last year, the lowest total in football. Fewer possessions mean fewer chances to rack up totals.

In conclusion, if we prorate each set of numbers to a 16-game season, Wallace has been about twice as good with Roethlisberger in the lineup as he has been without. Therefore, there is a possibility that Wallace could be even more effective in a different team with better conditions.",chatgpt,ai-generated

"Spiders have a sweet tooth, or so to speak. Scientists have recently discovered that these arachnids, despite their reputation as pure carnivores, have a rather unique dietary habit. Some species of spiders, it seems, consume pollen grains as a regular component of their diet, making up nearly a quarter of their food intake.

Spider webs are meticulously engineered hunting tools that trap insects and other aerial prey. However, these masterfully crafted webs can also ensnare pollen grains and fungal spores. In order to investigate whether spiders were indeed taking advantage of these non-insect food sources, researchers conducted feeding experiments and stable isotope analysis on young spiders.

Based on the findings of the research, about 25% of the spiders' diet consisted of pollen grains, while the remaining 75% came from flying insects. Furthermore, the spiders that consumed both pollen and insects received the optimal nourishment, with all essential nutrients delivered by the combination.

""The proportion of pollen in the spiders' diet in the wild was high, so we need to classify them as omnivores rather than carnivores,"" Dirk Sanders, one of the researchers, said in a news release.

What's more surprising is that the spiders actively target pollen grains by coating them with digestive enzymes before ingestion, indicating their preference for the nutrients found in pollen. Orb web spiders were also found to eat their webs to recycle silk proteins, and in doing so, consume pollen grains.

""This study provides evidence that spiders are not purely carnivorous, but can take advantage of a range of food sources. It contributes to a growing body of research that is challenging our traditional perceptions of spider ecology and behavior,"" Sanders added.

The discovery of spiders consuming pollen challenges the common perception of spiders as deadly predators which feed solely on other living animals. The findings of this study make it clear that spiders are not only predators but adept omnivores that can take advantage of a variety of food sources. The study has been published in the journal PLOS One.",chatgpt,ai-generated
"Between State and Anarchy: A Model of Government by Fred E. Foldvary School of Management Anarchy and Liberty Seminar at John F. Kennedy University, Université du Québec, Hull 1. The moral foundation of fair government 2. Communitarian democracy 3. Secession 4. Government money 5. Between anarchism and minarchism, there is geo-archism 1. The moral foundation of fair government The relationship between anarchy, freedom, and government needs to start with a moral foundation from which to draw conclusions about political and economic policy. John Locke laid the groundwork for a moral code that everyone can agree on. But Locke didn't say where this idea came from. First, I'll explain how the universal ethic comes from my 1980 book The Soul of Liberty, and then I'll use it to answer the question of how to run a country. Locke wrote in his Second Treatise (1947, p. 123), ""The state of nature is governed by a law of nature that everyone must obey; and reason, which is that law, teaches all people who are willing to look at it that, since we are all equal and independent, no one should hurt another person's life, health, freedom, or possessions."" This short sentence sums up the main ideas and parts of Locke's natural law, which will be the basis for the universal ethic that will be shown here. I say that ""morality"" is when an ethic gives moral values. This idea can be summed up as: V 7 e(A), where A is a person's action, e is an ethical principle, and V is one of the four moral values: good, bad, neutral, or undetermined. When the ethic e is applied to act A, it gives V its value. The question at hand is whether there is a universal ethic ""u"" that is different from cultural and personal values. This is despite the idea of subjective values, which says that all values come from individual interests and cultures. ""And reason, which is that law,"" Locke says. The universal ethic is based on logic, and logic means that it is not made up on the spot, so it is a rational ethic. But in order to figure out such a code of ethics, we have to be able to recognize it once we know its rules. How will we know when we've created a moral code that everyone can agree on? We need some rules. In the above quote, Locke said that ""reason teaches all mankind"" and that all people are ""equal and independent."" All is the key word here. The domain of the universal ethic (the ""A"" in the argument) must include all people. It is universal because it applies to all people in all cultures and at all times and places. This is the first thing to look for. The universal ethic must also be ""comprehensive,"" which means that it includes all the things that a person does. It would lose its universality if some acts were left out. So, all acts are included, which is the second criterion for the ethical domain. There are also two rules about the ethics themselves. Locke said that it is reason that teaches people what is right and wrong, so the ethic must be based on logic and the conclusion must match the premises. Reason also says that the premises themselves can't be arbitrary or based on personal or cultural values or authorities. This is the second criterion for the ethics itself. There are a total of four criteria: 1) universality in terms of people, 2) completeness in terms of acts, 3) logical consistency, and 4) non-arbitrary premises. The reason the universal ethic exists is because it is the only thing that meets all of the criteria. Accepting the criteria means that if someone can show an ethic that works for them in a unique way, then that ethic is the universal ethic. Based on these rules, the universal ethic, if it exists, must be unique. Either the premises of a second universal ethic must be different and in conflict with the first, or its rules must be compatible with the first's, so that the two can be combined into a single ethic. So, there can only be one set of moral rules that everyone must follow. What the Universal Ethic Stands On So, where will we get the premises we need for the derivation? ""The state of nature has a law of nature,"" Locke said again. The ""universal ethic"" is the ""law of nature."" It is ""the state of nature"" and ""the ethics of nature."" What kind of thing is this? It's clear that it's not the nature of the stars or atoms that matters, but the nature of what the ethic is about: people. The nature of human beings (and whichever other species may be ""persons"") is such that it contains or implies an ethic. So, the premises from which the universal ethic can be drawn have to do with:",paraphrase,ai-generated
"NFL Players Searching For Painkiller Choices

Like many athletes, football players look for alternatives to painkillers. They have been linked to opioid addiction and overdose, which claimed the life of former Chicago Bears quarterback Dave Duerson.

In this week's ""All Things Considered"" series on pain, NPR's Melissa Block speaks with Seattle Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright about how he deals with pain. He says he tries not to use painkillers. Instead, he has a team of specialists help him with other methods, such as acupuncture and cupping.

MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:

On this program, we're going to be talking a lot this week about pain. The federal government estimates that 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, and we're going to hear from patients, from doctors and from others who are searching for solutions.

Today, we turn to football, a sport where pain is a constant. Players are routinely injured, often severely. So how do they cope? We're going to hear from K.J. Wright of the Seattle Seahawks. He's a linebacker who's been in the NFL for nine years. He's just had surgery on his left knee.

K.J. Wright, welcome to the program.

K.J. WIGHT: Thank you.

BLOCK: How do you deal with the pain?

WIGHT: Well, you know, I try not to use painkillers. I have a team of specialists that help me with other methods, like acupuncture and cupping.

BLOCK: What do you think about the opioid epidemic?

WIGHT: I think it's terrible. I mean, it's taken a lot of lives, and I think it's something that we need to address.

BLOCK: Have you been tempted to use painkillers?

WIGHT: No, I haven't.

BLOCK: Do you think that other players in the NFL are using painkillers?

WIGHT: I don't know. I haven't talked to them about it.

BLOCK: You don't think that they might?

WIGHT: I don't know. It's tough to say. I mean, you know, it's an individual thing.

BLOCK: What do you think about the NFL's efforts to address the opioid epidemic?

"Security is of utmost importance, but maintaining it can be challenging, especially when it comes to remembering unique passwords for every account we create. It is well known that using easily guessable passwords, such as a pet's name or birthday, is no longer safe. A strong password should contain a random mix of letters, numbers, and symbols and be several characters long, but this also makes them impossible to remember. 

Fortunately, Google Play Services is introducing OAuth 2.0, a system that provides strong security without the inconvenience of remembering multiple passwords. OAuth 2.0 aims to enhance the user experience by eliminating the need to sign in multiple times with different passwords. Developers who implement OAuth 2.0 in their apps or games can enable these applications to authenticate your device through your Google account. This means you only need to enter your Google password once, significantly simplifying the sign-in process.

To utilize OAuth 2.0, your device needs Google Play services, and it is compatible with Android devices running version 2.2 or later. Entering passwords has long been a tedious task on smartphones, so the ability to access a mobile webpage or app without entering a password each time greatly improves the user experience.

Developers can begin implementing OAuth 2.0 in their apps and games by following the guidelines on the Android Developers Blog. The rollout is already in progress, and we can expect to see apps utilizing this service within a few weeks.

While this is a convenient solution, users should ensure they employ lock screen protection or install an anti-theft app to keep their devices secure if lost or stolen. This new feature is a step forward in terms of simplifying our digital lives, but security should never be compromised. We encourage developers and users to share their thoughts on this new approach to security and convenience.",gpt-4,ai-generated

"One has large, brown eyes and is black. The other has the palest complexion and blonde hair with blue eyes. Although having the same cheeky smile, they hardly resemble one other when placed side by side. Amazingly, Kian and Remee were born a minute apart as identical twins. Seven years after their birth, black and white twin twins Kian (left) and Remee (right) are still in love with one other. The two inherited a one in a million DNA combination from their parents, which gave them their appearance. Father Remi Horder and mother Kylee Hodgson both have black fathers and white mothers. A pair of adorable tiny girls in two tones are the startling outcome. When they were featured in the Mail at less than a year old, they initially drew recognition on a global scale. They have never questioned why they don't look the same and have never encountered racial prejudice as they reach their seventh birthday. Their mother told the Mail that they serve as the ideal example of how things ought to be. They don't give a damn about the color of their skin. It's not the major problem that everybody else seems to think it is. It doesn't matter to them at all; what matters is who they are on the inside. In April 2005, a caesarean section was used to deliver Kian and her sister, who is 60 seconds older. Sister group: The twins' primary school grades and hobbies differ from one another. Now 25 years old, Kylee remembers the first time she saw them: She observed that each of them had stunning blue eyes. Yet, Kian had black hair and darker skin than Remee, who had blonde hair. They were my kids, and to me, they were just ordinary people. I anticipated that as time passed, they would begin to resemble one another. Yet time simply made their differences more obvious. Kian's skin darkened and her eyes changed color. Remee's complexion grew paler and her blonde, curly hair didn't change. Unsurprisingly, when Kylee pushed them in their side-by-side buggy, she was confronted with inquiries about whose kids they were and the identity of Kian's fair-haired pal. Others frequently questioned Kylee about why she dressed the kids the same. I'd just state, ""Because they're twins,"" and let folks figure it out on their own. At first, that kind of upset me, but when word spread that they were twins, everyone in my neighborhood came to accept it. Only strangers or outsiders were ignorant. The twins are already acting in their own unique ways while having a shared relationship. The 2006 reporting style for the incident Although they have an ebony and ivory appearance, their personalities resemble chalk and cheese. Despite the fact that their first words, ""Juice!"" were the same, they learned to walk and talk at separate times. Her mother claims that Kian ""is a little bossier, a little louder"". Remee is a little more laid back, she said. She will give it some more thought before acting. ONE MILLION BABIES The likelihood of twins of different colors from a mixed-race couple is one in a million. Up to seven distinct genes are thought to cooperate to define skin color. A parent's eggs or sperm will have a combination of genetic material for both black and white skin if they are biracial. Nonetheless, a newborn will be white if both the egg and the sperm have just white DNA. And if only the variants required for black skin are present in both, the child will also be black. They attend separate classes at school today and hang around with various groups of people. They both enjoy singing along and dancing to the same music, primarily Rihanna and New York rapper Nicki Minaj. Yet Kian loves animals, whilst her sister likes to cook, thus their interests are different. Nonetheless, they share an unspoken, almost intuitive bond with their twins, as do many pairs. ""They get along so well,"" remarked Kylee, who is currently divorced from Remi and resides in Dudley, West Midlands. They are quite close, she remarked. They are the greatest of friends and adore one another. They play together constantly, go swimming together, read books together, and offer assistance to one another. The other will assist if one is unable to do their shoes. They occasionally perform the same actions simultaneously. They even even shared a sneeze. I was actually laughing at it. They have taught each other everything as they have grown older. They have supported one another's growth.",paraphrase,ai-generated

"Title: Recreating the Bold and Flashy Keyboard Sounds of the 1970s

In the 1970s, keyboard-playing rock stars dominated the scene, with piano parts that boasted distinctive octaves and rolling rhythms. The key to capturing the essence of this era is breaking up chords in a rhythmic way while still accompanying the vocals. Let's explore some techniques to add a vibrant 70s vibe to your keyboard tracks.

1. Classic '70s Piano Part

To begin, let's look at a typical modern pop piano progression in the key of C. By slightly altering the part, we arrive at a period piano part reminiscent of the 1970s, featuring octaves in the right hand, broken up rhythms, counter-melodies and wide shifts in dynamics. This bold and dramatic part reflects the distinctive sound of that era.

2. Emulating an Entire Ensemble

In the 1970s, keyboard players often assumed the role of an entire ensemble. Begin by laying down a funky bassline, utilizing both glissando and pitch bend. Sync the bass with the drums, allowing the music to breathe. Next, incorporate a rhythmic Clavinet part, alternating the rhythm of the left and right hands to create a sense of motion. Use short notes and smaller chord voicings for added effect.

Add a vintage analog string synth or string ensemble playing single lines above the range of the Clavinet to create a layered sound. Implementing phase shifting and reverberation will also add motion and depth, resulting in a full, funky and beautiful track.

3. Channeling Steely Dan's Rhodes

The Rhodes electric piano is an excellent instrument for harmonizing a song, as exemplified by the legendary band Steely Dan. A basic Rhodes piano part features chord roots in the left hand and jumpy chord motion with sustained chords.

To recreate Steely Dan's iconic sound, expand the chord palate to include jazz voicings and leading tones, employ a chromatically engaging left hand part, and adopt a conversational, two-handed approach. Enhance the '70s-style sound with stereo chorus and phase shifting processing.

Mastering these techniques will help infuse your keyboard tracks with the captivating, energetic and unforgettable sounds of the 1970s.",gpt-4,ai-generated
"Over the past two decades, the use of underground robots to patrol the US-Mexico border has become increasingly commonplace, highlighting the role of seemingly science fiction-like technology in our everyday lives. These semi-autonomous vehicles are just one part of an evolving and diverse array of devices used by US border patrol agents. With new designs and technical capabilities being incorporated regularly, innovative tools from the field of robotics and media technology are making their way into police work and border security measures.

One recent example of such a technology is the deployment of a wireless camera drone. This versatile and advanced device is capable of navigating through intricate tunnel networks and recording their interiors. By accessing and documenting difficult-to-reach areas, these robots enhance authorities' ability to patrol parts of the border in otherwise dangerous subterranean passages, including storm drains, culverts, and elaborate smuggling tunnels. This effectively reduces the risk of harm faced by border patrol agents while performing their duties.

In addition to the use of robotic vehicles, the US-Mexico border is witnessing the deployment of various surveillance tools, such as camera towers, unmanned aerial drones, and a wide range of wireless technology. This transformation is gradually turning the border into a high-tech security apparatus which seems more like an advanced media studio than a typical national boundary. As a result, the border patrol experience is starting to resemble a large-scale, surreal underground media project.

This migration towards advanced technology has also led to interesting developments in the realm of border robotics. The exploration of the outermost edge of the nation-state has given rise to autonomous camera zones, operating within the depths of subterranean passages. As opposed to relying solely on manned patrols, little imperial devices now slither and snake their way through these labyrinthine tunnels. In this way, the field of border robotics enhances the security, efficiency, and overall capabilities of border control agents along the US-Mexico border.

However, while these advances in technology have undoubtedly offered improvements in terms of border security, they have also sparked concerns about privacy and ethical implications. The increased use of robotic devices, drones, and other sophisticated surveillance tools raises questions about potential overreach and infringement upon individual rights, as well as the overall impact of technology on the future of border control and law enforcement.

In conclusion, the integration of robotics and advanced technology into the US-Mexico border patrols has significantly altered the experience of border security, while also raising important questions about the implications and uses of such technology. As these innovations continue to expand, it will be crucial to balance their potential benefits with the need to maintain respect for privacy and civil rights.",gpt-4,ai-generated
"The American currency is set to get a fresh look as the US Treasury Department replaces the face on the $10 bill with a ""notable woman."" The department had organised a poll asking people to vote on which prominent woman of history they would like to see depicted on the new note. The poll was arranged by the women's advocacy group, Women on 20s. Harriet Tubman, the legendary abolitionist, came out on top with 50,000 votes. The former first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, who served as wife of President Franklin Roosevelt, and Rosa Parks, an activist in the civil rights movement, were also on the shortlist.

The US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew says that bills are a good way to represent American values and that new $10 bills will be available featuring the woman's face, while still keeping the image of Alexander Hamilton. Hamilton was one of the founding fathers of the United States, an important figure in shaping America and a subject of a popular Broadway musical.

The Treasury Department originally planned to replace Andrew Jackson's portrait on the $20 bill with a woman’s portrait, but eventually decided to keep Jackson on the front of the bill and put a woman on the back. However, Jackson was a controversial figure in US history, particularly regarding his attitude towards Native Americans, and some groups are still calling for him to be replaced.

Harriet Tubman was an ideal candidate to replace Jackson. Born into slavery, she escaped and later worked as a spy and nurse for the Union army during the Civil War. She is remembered for leading hundreds of slaves to freedom on the Underground Railroad. Tubman will be the first woman to be featured on American paper currency in over a century.

The US has rarely changed the face on its paper bills, making this a particularly historic event. The new design will be introduced in 2020, the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote.",chatgpt,ai-generated
"California farmers now must abide by a 3 percent salinity-level standard and are working toward a 1 percent standard.

The state's coastal stream salinity standards are designed to protect a variety of species, including steelhead and salmon.

""The water quality in the San Joaquin River and its tributaries is extremely important to the state's economy and its environment,"" said Jane Diamond, director of the state's Water Resources Control Board. ""We are committed to working with the agricultural industry to ensure that the salinity standards are met.""

The state has established a water-quality monitoring program in the San Joaquin River and its tributaries.

The U.S. Geological Survey and CalFed, a state-federal partnership, are conducting the program.

The program will help farmers and others comply with the state's salinity standards.

The program will also help scientists understand the impact of agricultural practices on water quality and the health of aquatic species.

The 3 percent salinity-level standard applies to all surface water in the state, including rivers, creeks and streams.

The 1 percent salinity-level standard applies to all groundwater and irrigation water in the state.

The state began enforcing the 3 percent salinity-level standard in July 2009.

The 1 percent salinity-level standard will take effect in 2020.

"Did you catch the latest buzz? The Avengers had a spectacular opening weekend in the US, raking in an astounding $207.4 million. It seems Disney accountants initially missed a pile of movie stubs, as the initial report valued the weekend at $200.3 million. As impressive as that is, let's not forget that the movie had already premiered internationally, amassing a whopping $447.4 million in just 12 days. Talk about being the talk of the town!

Warner Bros. were likely to cancel their celebratory bash for setting a debut record of $169.2 million last July with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Pt. 2. After all, who would want to party in face of such a crushing defeat?

This doesn't come as a surprise, considering how universally appealing superheroes are. Harry Potter, on the other hand, is more generation-specific. Not to mention, The Avengers had a rich universe of beloved characters and stories to draw from, ensuring their widespread success.

Joss Whedon's expertise as a writer and director is not to be overlooked either. A captivating blend of intense emotion, suspense, and comic relief made The Avengers a truly satisfying experience. A stellar cast and strong character arcs, particularly for Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, were the cherry on top. Though heavily reliant on CGI, strong storytelling helped The Avengers avoid the fate of CGI-centric films like Wrath of the Titans.

It's also worth noting that higher ticket prices for 3D and IMAX screenings could have contributed to the film's impressive earnings. However, what's truly remarkable is that people were willing to spend the extra amount, given the bleak state of the economy. In Orange, CA, every IMAX seat, costing $16.50 - $18.50, sold out that weekend.

Maybe it's time for economists to take note – and maybe it's time to enjoy The Avengers in IMAX.",gpt-4,ai-generated
"A large group of protestors gathered to confront Texas Governor Rick Perry as he arrived at Popovers on the Square on Thursday morning. The demonstrators made it clear that they do not support his plans to overhaul Social Security and Medicare.

""Hands off Medicare! Hands off Medicare!"" chanted the protestors, members of the New Hampshire Alliance of Retired Americans, in unison. Some held signs declaring ""No Texas trash talk,"" and ""Social Security is not a Ponzi scheme.""

When asked by a reporter about the protestors, Perry responded, ""If they're all senior citizens then they have nothing to worry about.""

Amidst a swarm of television cameras, journalists, and photographers, Perry greeted both citizens and Popovers' employees like Whitney Bresson, who offered the Texas governor a popover and some chilled water.

""That's amazing after the pancake I just had,"" Perry commented while a voter in the background shouted, ""Let them eat cake, governor!""

Bresson and several colleagues relished their encounter with the Republican Presidential candidate. ""He was very pleasant and had a firm handshake,"" she remarked.

Despite the protestors, Perry discovered a wealth of support for his Presidential aspirations, which he announced just last weekend in South Carolina, instantly influencing the Republican Presidential primary race.

Mike Esthers of Portsmouth, one of Perry's supporters, had his family take a photo with the governor. ""There are plenty of people here who support Rick Perry and appreciate his policies,"" Esthers told one of the demonstrators before the governor arrived at Popovers.

Martha Fuller Clark, a former State Senator from Portsmouth and Democrat, questioned Perry about his stance on global warming, which the Texas governor has not entirely endorsed. ""The verdict is still out,"" Perry informed her.

Fuller Clark expressed worry over Perry's refusal to consider the scientific research on global warming. ""We could have a president who is unwilling to acknowledge scientific facts,"" she lamented. ""All you have to do is look at what's happening in Greenland.""

"When you agree with two opposing individuals, the world begins to feel confusing. This feeling occurs for some individuals with regards to economics because of the debates between Dinesh D’Souza and Paul Krugman. Now, both of them are partly right, but neither of them hits the specific discussion that needs to be made that revolves around capitalism’s present form.

Warren Buffet explained succinctly how his “class, the rich class” is effectively waging war through class warfare. What this means is that the American system benefits the wealthy, with countless market interventions exclusively aimed at assisting corporations and individuals who remain unaffected by the plight that working-class people face. 

Those who advocate for shielding economic titans for criticism are misguided because these individuals often receive unjust assistance from the American government’s anti-market policies. From intellectual property protection to licensing requirements, zoning mandates, and taxes, the economic opportunities for working people are frequently marginalized. This inequality is not just limited to the wealthy, as even average businesspeople who cannot leverage special government favors are treated much more gently than those taking advantage of government protections.

Although Dinesh D’Souza argues that “the anti-colonialist believes that since the rich have prospered at the expense of others, their wealth doesn’t really belong to them; therefore whatever can be extracted from them is automatically just,” he is ignoring the fact that this argument isn't solely about legitimate productivity. Rather, it is about unjustly winning elite status through government protection.

In truth, our biggest problem lies in the debate itself because we have been tricked into thinking that our only options as Americans are to either expand the power of the organization that caused the issue or retain a corporatist economy without any safety net for the poor. This binary is unsavory because those who utilize state power to bolster their bank accounts aren't friends of freedom or markets.

Fake free markets or morally corrupt state power are the only two credible political avenues available in mainstream American discourse, which means that any meaningful, free-market debate is stuck between two political sides who are more interested in self-serving, rather than resolving the issue at hand.",chatgpt,ai-generated

"Alex Hogrefe is the developer of Visualizing Architecture, a blog devoted to the art of architectural visualization education. He is also a member of the rendering studio Design Distill, which creates attractive graphics for architects worldwide. How can I give the image a more human touch? is a question that frequently enters my mind when I am creating architectural images. Almost always, Photoshop texturing is the solution. I have spent the past week illustrating a bird's-eye view for my most recent personal project. For this particular piece, I wanted to test what would happen if I applied a heavy texture to nearly every surface of the image. There were a number of details that I would ordinarily overlook in other illustrations, but not in this one. The end result is an image with age-related flaws. Base Rendering It can be difficult to avoid ""tiling"" of textures in 3D environments, despite the importance of texture mapping. Frequently, my foundation renderings appear flat and ""perfect,"" meaning the texture is flawless. This is because I have limited control over bump maps and texture characteristics. At some point, time spent texturing in a 3D scene might be accomplished considerably more quickly in Photoshop. After creating so many illustrations over the years, I am beginning to understand that threshold and when I must go from 3D to 2D post-processing. To achieve the desired aesthetic, I frequently require both a decent texture in the 3D model and a nice texture in Photoshop. Texture Zones I focused on four aspects for this illustration: the surrounding context's rooftops, the textures of my design, the roadways, and the sidewalks/landscape. All four of these regions are interdependent, and if one is left untreated, the ""plastic"" feel of the computer is shown and the impression is lost. Selecting Textures Many photographs of asphalt roads were utilized to create textures to my illustration in Photoshop. They have the appropriate amount of grime and flaws and can be used in locations other than streets. In this instance, I applied asphalt textures to the rooftops of the buildings and, after decreasing their opacity, even to the concrete and brick sidewalks. Before And after textures Prior-to-After Comparison A side-by-side comparison demonstrates how effective Photoshop texturing can be. I've realized that components such as roads and rooftops, which I frequently observe artists ignoring in their illustrations, make a significant impact in giving an image a human touch. Including these minor flaws begins to convince the viewer that the image is not computer-generated. The Last Image Using the use of orange color overlays, I warmed up the hues in this final image. Using plugins such as Topaz Labs Adjust, I enhanced the detail and clarity of a number of my illustrations. Typically, I disable perspective for aerials, but in this case I left it on and enlarged the field of view in SketchUp to make the structures appear higher. The perspective is effective because it attracts attention to the image's center and highlights the design. All photographs were taken by Alex Hogrefe.

"In a recent interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Rep. Michele Bachmann expressed her dissatisfaction with losing her health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. She discussed how, before this change, her family was content with their previous health insurance. However, she now claimed she was frustrated with the current situation.

During her conversation with Democratic strategist Paul Begala, Bachmann was asked whether she had considered exploring the Washington, D.C. health insurance marketplace to see how Obamacare might actually benefit her family. The Congresswoman responded that she had no intention of wasting her time on an online system that had experienced technical difficulties and frustrated many users.

Bachmann's frustration with her loss of coverage highlighted the fact that many people have had their insurance policies canceled due to Obamacare, but this situation obscures an essential detail: the decisions taken by her own Republican colleagues played a pivotal role in her predicament. 

The measure that compelled members of Congress to relinquish their existing employer coverage, provided by the federal government, and switch to the Obamacare insurance marketplaces for new plans, was initially a Republican proposal. This tactical decision by the Republicans was originally designed as a 'poison-pill' to put Democratic lawmakers in a bind. 

The proposal, also known as the Grassley amendment, came about through an amendment offered by Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) while an early version of the Affordable Care Act was still in committee. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) did the same in a separate committee. Grassley's name ultimately stuck to the amendment because he continuously advocated for the policy while the law was being debated. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid eventually included the policy, using language closer to Coburn's version, in the final bill that combined versions from the two Senate committees. The policy became law in 2010.

"In an industry marked by long queues, delayed flights, overcrowded airplanes, and cancelled travel plans, Henrik Zillmer, co-founder of AirHelp, is passionate about standing up for the rights of passengers, enabling them to fight back when things go wrong. The idea behind AirHelp is simple: help air travel customers from all around the world get paid for flight delays, overbooking, and cancellations. 

Zillmer became interested in the industry when he faced flight troubles in his personal life. Frustrated with the lack of accountability and transparency from airlines, he decided to take the issue into his own hands. He started researching the laws, international flight guidelines, and legal cases against airlines. After years of gathering information and advocating for consumer rights, he realised that there were 26 million passengers every year who were legally entitled to hundreds of dollars in compensation, but only being paid less than 1% of the total amount they were owed. 

Armed with this information, Zillmer founded AirHelp in 2013 along with Nicolas Michaelsen and Greg Roodt. The company aims to help those who have been denied compensation after flight troubles or have been ignored by airlines when claiming for it. This compensation service, which is based on a contingency model, fights for the rights of passengers and demands fair compensation from airlines. When the passenger receives the compensation, the company takes a 25% cut. 

One of the main reasons why airline customers drop their compensation claims is that the process is often complicated, cumbersome, and time-consuming, requiring them to collate and send multiple documents to several entities. This is where AirHelp comes in: its main goal is to support customers with its expertise in the field and regulatory requirements, making sure that they receive the compensation they deserve. AirHelp's algorithm collects publicly available data on delayed flights, combines it with national, international, and regional laws, and cross-checks it against previous court rulings. Using this data, the company can determine the amount of compensation owed to passengers, file a claim on their behalf, and ensure that each claim is processed as efficiently and correctly as possible. 

One of the biggest challenges that AirHelp faces in its mission is getting the airlines to take their claims seriously. Zillmer reveals that airlines often play dirty, like requiring AirHelp to supply them with a signed power of attorney form for every client. Although many airlines insist that board passes are required, some passengers now use mobile boarding passes, leading to confusion and delays in the compensation process. According to Zillmer, airlines are not meeting their responsibilities as service providers, leading to repeat customers and low consumer satisfaction ratings. 

In addition to helping individual passengers, AirHelp also works to raise awareness about consumer rights within the airline industry. The company is encouraging customers to hold airlines more accountable for their mistakes and increasing the likelihood of getting compensation if there is a problem during their flight. AirHelp prioritises customer support and has successfully dealt with over 20 court cases, winning nearly all of them. 

The company's platform has been enjoyed by tens of thousands of people worldwide, with many customers commending AirHelp’s customer service, speed, and ease of use. At TechCrunch Disrupt in New York, Zillmer unveiled a new email tool to help passengers sift through their emails and determine whether their flights from up to three years ago were entitled to compensation. With a funding round currently underway, Zillmer plans to expand the company further, potentially offering airport concierge services to ensure that customers always get the support they need. 

AirHelp’s business model is at the forefront of a growing trend in the start-up industry of firms seeking to fight back against corporations and protect the rights of consumers. While the airlines may continue to play dirty, Zillmer and his team continue their ongoing efforts to support passengers and ensure that airlines live up to their responsibilities.",chatgpt,ai-generated
"Spanish woman registers ownership of the sun and wants to impose a fee on everyone for its use

A woman from the Galicia region of Spain, Angeles Duran, has registered the sun as her property with a local notary public, according to the online edition of daily El Mundo. Duran, 49, took the step after reading about an American man who had registered himself as the owner of the moon and most planets in the solar system. She claims that there is no international agreement that prevents an individual claiming ownership of a star. The document issued by the notary public states that Duran is the “owner of the Sun, a star of spectral type G2, located in the center of the solar system, located at an average distance from Earth of about 149,600,000 kilometers.”

Duran, who lives in the town of Salvaterra do Mino, intends to impose a fee on everyone who uses the sun and wishes to give half of the proceeds to the Spanish government and 20% to the nation’s pension fund. She also plans to dedicate 10% each to research and ending world hunger, with the remaining 10% being retained by herself. She argues that if there are ideas that could generate income and improve the economy and people’s well-being, then they should be pursued.

The legality of Duran’s claim is questionable as notary documents do not enjoy full legal recognition under Spanish law, and international space law recognises only the rights of states and not individuals.",chatgpt,ai-generated

Name: Rachael Brister

Age: 28

Height: 5’6”

Before Weight: 220 pounds

How I Gained It: I’ve struggled with my weight for my entire life. In high school and college, I tried to lose weight through crash dieting, which never worked. After college, I moved back home and the pounds started to creep on. I was eating whatever I wanted and not working out, and my weight continued to climb. By the time I was 26, I was 220 pounds and completely miserable.

The Breaking Point: I really wanted to get married and have children, but a year after I was engaged, I was still overweight and felt like I couldn’t live up to my potential as a wife. My fiancé and I were planning a beach wedding, and I was too self-conscious to even consider wearing a swimsuit. I knew that something had to change.

How I Lost It: I started working with a nutritionist, and we came up with a plan to eat healthier and work out. My fiancé was really supportive, and he helped me to make some lifestyle changes. I started working out six days a week and gradually cut back on my calorie intake. I lost 40 pounds in six months, and I was finally able to fit into a swimsuit for my wedding!

Since Weight-Loss Win: I’ve maintained my weight loss, and I now weigh 131 pounds. I’m so happy with my body now, and I never would have been able to achieve my goal if it weren’t for Weight-Loss Win.

"The RSA recently released a comprehensive report examining the so-called ""VOHO"" attacks which targeted pro-democracy, military industrial base, and high finance firms. Despite its thorough analysis, the report left one critical question unanswered: who, or what, was behind these sophisticated and widespread attacks? Although the malware used in the recent ""watering hole"" attacks provides some clues about the origins of the attacks, it is not sufficient to conclusively attribute them to any specific group, country, or actor.

Chris Elisan, a Principal Malware Scientist at RSA and the lead investigator into the malware used in the VOHO attacks, explains that the malware itself is only one part of the puzzle. Other essential components in the ""attack chain"" are needed to identify the source of the attack as coming from a specific country, known hacking crew, cybercriminal gang, or cyber warfare unit. Along with the malware, one would need information about the command and control (C&C) infrastructure, drop zones (for stolen data), and the malware update servers. It is the combination of these technical elements that allows experts to identify the human element behind the attack; however, this process takes time.

As of now, Elisan says that researchers need more time to gather evidence about the attacks before they can offer any insights on the origin of the cyber-assault. When asked whether there were any indications in the decompiled binaries collected from the attack that suggested the attacks originated in China, as many speculate, or from another country, Elisan admits that even if such indicators are present, they might not be conclusive. For instance, someone could plant Chinese sayings or characters to mislead investigators.

The official RSA report on the water holing or VOHO attacks is also cautious when it comes to drawing conclusions about attribution. The report does not make a direct reference to China but acknowledges that a component of the VOHO attacks, a script dubbed xKungfoos, ""likely originated in Asia"" where it was used to launch attacks on political dissidents.

An earlier report by security firm Symantec provided a similar assessment of the sophisticated attacks and use of watering hole sites. Symantec attributed the attacks to what it called the ""Elderwood Project"" or the ""Elderwood Platform"" but did not provide any definitive information about who owns or operates the so-called Elderwood.

The RSA report notes that the eight-month-old VOHO attacks share several similarities with the Aurora and GhostNet attacks, both attributed directly to the Chinese government. It also points out that the C&C infrastructure was found ""in the Hong Kong area."" Symantec's report, too, mentions that human rights and religious groups concentrated mainly in China were the second most common target after Western defense industries. However, conclusive attribution of the VOHO attacks to China remains elusive.

Attribution in cyber-attacks is always a difficult matter. Several experts have criticized RSA for the lack of clarity in the VOHO report. For instance, Jeffrey Carr, founder and CEO of TAIA Global, notes that the report seems to assume that China is behind the attacks, merely due to the use of the term ""APT"", which Carr believes is a poorly kept code word for China. Carr argues that connecting the use of specific scripts or the geographic location of C&C servers with the cyber-attack's origin does not meet the standard of proof required for attribution.

As researchers continue to piece together clues, it is evident that the attacks were not opportunistic or solely criminal in nature. The attackers chose their ""watering hole"" sites and techniques carefully, targeting enterprises and organizations rather than individuals. While this level of sophistication does point to a potentially geopolitical motivation for the attacks, determining the true origin remains a challenge.

Ultimately, rather than attributing an attack to a specific group or nation, the primary focus should be on the victims and their defenses against such cyber threats. Regardless of the source, better defenses are essential to ensure a more robust and cyber-secure environment. In the end, attribution is only important or relevant for victims if they have the capability and interest in retaliating; what matters most is improving defenses against such attacks, regardless of their origin.",gpt-4,ai-generated
"Studies have long demonstrated that men and women approach problems requiring cooperation differently. Now, researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine have discovered how these differences are reflected in brain activity. The findings, published in Scientific Reports, could provide insight into the evolution of cooperative behavior between the sexes and potentially inform the development of new ways to enhance cooperative behavior.

While previous behavioral studies had already observed that women are more cooperative when being watched by other women, men tend to cooperate better in larger groups overall, and mixed-sex pairs cooperate in more diverse ways, the neurological basis for these differences had remained scarce. To explore this topic further, the Stanford researchers used a technique called hyperscanning to simultaneously record brain activity in pairs of same-sex and mixed-sex study participants while they interacted. Instead of using MRI, which requires lying still, the researchers employed near-infrared spectroscopy, allowing participants to sit upright and interact more naturally. In total, 222 participants took part, each assigned a partner of either the same or opposite sex.

The researchers observed that on average, male pairs performed better than female pairs in the cooperative tasks. However, the brain activity in both same-sex pairs was highly synchronized during the activity, indicating high levels of ""interbrain coherence."" Furthermore, increased coherence correlated with better performance on the cooperative task within same-sex pairs, but the location of coherence differed between male and female pairs.

Interestingly, male-female pairs performed just as well as male pairs in the cooperative tasks, despite not showing coherence. Future research may reveal how these sex-related differences in brain activity inform cooperation strategy.

Lead author Joseph Baker noted that the study is ""pretty exploratory"" and not representative of cooperation in all its forms. There may be other cooperative tasks where female pairs could outperform men. Moreover, the researchers did not measure activity in all parts of the brain, suggesting there could be other regions responsible for interbrain coherence.

The scientists' ongoing research could help uncover how cooperation evolved in humans and inform methods that use biofeedback to teach cooperation skills. ""We're absolutely hoping to learn enough information so that we might be able to design more effective therapies for [individuals with disorders like autism who have problems with social cognition],"" explained Baker.",gpt-4,ai-generated

But her best friend of 15 years, Melanie Coleman, 38, who she plans to marry, is still unsure about her feelings. 
Miss Coleman, who lives with Miss Sandhu in the village of Kineton, near Stratford-Upon-Avon, said: 'I've known Kam for 15 years, and I have never once thought of her as anything but a man. 
'The sex change hasn't made any difference to me. You would never look at her and think she was anything but a woman.'  But she added: 'I'm still not sure what to call her. I call her ""him"" at the moment, but I'm sure I can get used to it.' 
Miss Sandhu, who is unemployed and has been on the dole most of her life, said: 'I always felt like I was in the wrong body. I never felt comfortable in my skin. 
'I've been looking for a way to change my life for a long time, and the sex change was the final step. I'm excited about the prospect of being able to marry my best friend.' 
Miss Coleman said she is still trying to come to terms with the fact that her friend has undergone a sex change, but she is supportive. 
She said: 'I'm not sure what to call her yet, but I'm glad she's happy. I just hope she can find a job and get her life sorted out.' 
Miss Sandhu said she is not worried about how her friends will react when they find out she is transgender. 
She said: 'I'm confident that they will accept me for who I am. I'm just glad they're still my friends.'

"Title: Understanding the Difference Between Ocean Liners and Cruise Ships

The terms ""ocean liner"" and ""cruise ship"" are frequently used interchangeably in conversations; however, they represent two distinct types of passenger vessels, each built for different purposes.

An ocean liner is a vessel specifically designed to transport passengers from one point to another, such as on a transatlantic journey from Europe to America. Due to the possibility of encountering various weather conditions on these voyages, ocean liners have to be sturdily constructed, with a substantial amount of steel used in their hulls. These liners often feature a long, tapered bow that enables them to effortlessly cut through the waves, and they have a deep draft to ensure stability. Furthermore, ocean liners are built to reach high speeds to keep voyage durations reasonably short.

Famed examples of ocean liners include the SS United States, the Normandie, and the Queen Elizabeth 2. In recent years, the only new ocean liner built was Cunard's Queen Mary 2.

Cruise ships, on the other hand, are specifically engineered for passengers to embark on a round-trip journey, beginning and ending in the same port. A typical example would be a Caribbean cruise starting and finishing in Miami, Florida.

In the early days of the modern cruise industry, many cruise ships were retired ocean liners that were no longer servicing transatlantic routes, as that market had shifted to jet airliners. As the industry evolved in the 1970s, ship designers recognized that cruise ships did not require the same rigorous construction as ocean liners to safely navigate calmer waters. This realization led to cost-saving measures, resulting in lighter, wider, and box-like structures that could accommodate more passengers. The vessels also did not need to be as fast, as their voyages were more leisurely, which allowed for further fuel cost savings.

Over time, cruise ship design strayed from the classic ocean liner structure and began to incorporate more glass and aluminum, making them visually distinct from their predecessors. However, in recent years, the line between ocean liners and cruise ships has blurred somewhat. As cruise itineraries have expanded beyond the calm waters of the Caribbean and Mediterranean, many modern cruise ships have adopted characteristics of ocean liners, such as increased structural strength, higher speeds, and improved hydrodynamics. For instance, Royal Caribbean's Radiance-class vessels and Norwegian Cruise Line's Jewel-class ships can now achieve speeds that rival those of classic ocean liners.",gpt-4,ai-generated
"The anticipation surrounding Disney's upcoming Star Wars Land attraction continues to soar with each passing day. Eager fans can hardly wait to experience this immersive world themselves, and the latest news reveals that the themed offerings will extend far beyond just a few iconic rides. Indeed, the park is committed to integrating the rich lore and history of Star Wars in every possible detail, ensuring that visitors are truly immersed in the galaxy far, far away. A key element of this immersion will be the incorporation of the Force – the backbone of the Jedi and Sith way of life.

According to insider information from MakingStarWars.net, Disneyland's Star Wars Land attraction intends to create a fully interactive experience by strategically placing ""Force Opportunities"" throughout the park. Guests will be encouraged to engage with these features, which will offer them a chance to experience the power of the Force firsthand. Imagine lifting a boulder, pulling a lightsaber towards oneself, or even manipulating nearby objects – these are just a few examples of the exciting experiences that could be available.

However, as with any authentic Star Wars experience, not everyone will be successful in wielding the Force. In keeping with the spirit of the movies, mastering the Force will remain a special and rare gift, not something that can be learned through a quick online tutorial. The Force-based interactions will thus occur at random and unpredictable intervals, with some appearing more frequently and others succeeding only on rare occasions.

In addition to recreating the positive aspects of the Force, the park also aims to represent the darker side. Guests can expect to encounter opportunities to use the Force Choke and Force Lightning as they explore the themed attraction. This balanced approach will ensure that visitors have a comprehensive and authentic Star Wars experience, satisfying fans of both the Jedi and Sith.

Ultimately, Disney's Star Wars Land promises to be a groundbreaking attraction that offers visitors more than just a chance to engage with their favorite characters or board exciting rides. It's an opportunity to truly live and breathe the essence of the Star Wars universe, discovering its magic, powers, and history at every turn. It’s an adventurous journey that will delight both longtime Star Wars enthusiasts and newcomers alike, ensuring that the Force remains strong for generations to come.",gpt-4,ai-generated
"CHICAGO/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Monsanto Co on Tuesday forecast that its profit will likely fall next year as the strong dollar and low crop prices hurt demand for its pesticides and seeds, prompting the U.S. company to cut its quarterly dividend.

REUTERS/Larry W. Smith/Files

The world’s largest seed company’s forecast for a drop in earnings per share for next year was its first guidance for 2016, after it announced plans last month to buy the world’s biggest herbicide maker, Syngenta AG, to become a one-stop shop for crop chemicals and seeds.

Faced with a 26 percent fall in soybean seed sales and a 23 percent drop in corn seed sales this year, Monsanto has cut 5 percent of its labor force this year and has been closing seed production facilities. The company has said it will likely close more facilities, and it has warned that volatile commodity prices could lead to more such belt-tightening.

“The strong dollar and low prices for soybean, corn and other crops have significantly impacted Monsanto’s profitability,” Chief Financial Officer Robert Shapiro said on a conference call with reporters.

The company’s forecast for a profit of $5.5 billion in 2016 compared with $6.1 billion in 2015, and $5.8 billion in 2016 compared with $6.5 billion in 2015.

Monsanto said it would cut its quarterly dividend by 12 cents per share to $0.36 per share.

Shares of Monsanto were down 3.2 percent at $114.77 in premarket trading.

The strong dollar is making U.S. goods more expensive overseas, while low crop prices are hitting demand for Monsanto’s seed and pesticide products, Shapiro said.

“We expect commodity markets to remain volatile and there is potential for further reductions in our dividend as commodity prices and costs continue to fluctuate,” Shapiro said.

Monsanto has been buying assets to bolster its offerings in the face of a potential slowdown in the global food market.

"Title: A Fair Look at the 2014 Godzilla Film

Author: Patrick L. Shan | October 7, 2014

Rating: 7/10 | A Decent Addition to the Godzilla Franchise

Even though the 2014 Godzilla film falls short compared to classics like the 1954 original or Mothra vs. Godzilla, it still deserves praise. The visual effects impressively depict larger-than-life monsters, from their movements to their distinctive personalities. Infused with emotions like joy, love, despair, and wrath, each creature feels multidimensional—even the MUTOs, despite their unremarkable appearance. And of course, Godzilla retains his signature indestructibility and atomic breath.

The biggest drawback of the film, according to most fans, is the limited screen time given to Godzilla himself. Yes, other monster-focused movies like Jurassic Park, Aliens, Predator, and Jaws spend much of their runtime on human characters, but those films offer likable, well-defined characters that the audience can root for.

Unfortunately, in Godzilla, Aaron Taylor-Johnson's portrayal of Ford falls flat, lacking the stoic intensity of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Clint Eastwood. The potential subplot of Ford harboring animosity toward Godzilla could have been compelling, but it remains unexplored. Similarly, Elizabeth Olsen's Elle fails to convincingly convey emotional anguish or concern for her patients and family. Bryan Cranston's Joe and Ken Watanabe's Sherizawa are also overshadowed by these two-dimensional leads.

The film's creators have a simple solution for future Godzilla entries: either give the iconic monster more screen time or hire better actors and flesh out the human characters to make them more memorable. Nevertheless, the 2014 Godzilla film remains an entertaining watch, and fans are eager for what the sequel has in store.",gpt-4,ai-generated

"Firearms WIP A RWBY lore-fic By A.R.

Aura was a force to be reckoned with. It was the manifestation of a person's soul, and as such, was incredibly powerful. It was also very dangerous. Aura was the source of a person's strength, speed, durability, and other physical abilities. It was also the source of their Semblance.

All of this made it very difficult to control.

That was why most people only used a small fraction of their Aura. It was simply too dangerous to let loose.

But there were those who did.

 Hunters and Huntresses, for example, used their Aura to fight Grimm. They had to be able to access all of their power in order to stand a chance against the creatures of Grimm.

And then there were those who used their Aura for other purposes.

Some used it to create powerful weapons. Others used it to enhance their own bodies. And still others used it to create other things entirely.

But all of them had one thing in common: they were using their Aura in ways that it was not meant to be used.

And that was why they were called ""forgers"".

Forgers were people who used their Aura to create things that were not supposed to exist. They were the masters of their own destiny, and as such, they were very dangerous.

But that was also why they were so fascinating.

Forgers were unpredictable. They could do things that no one else could.

And that was why they were so exciting.

A.R. was a forger.

He had been doing it for as long as he could remember.

He had started out by creating simple things. Things that he could use himself. Things like knives and shields and clothing.

But as he got better, he started to create more complicated things. Things that could do things that no other objects could.

He had created machines that could shoot arrows and move on their own. He had created weapons that could cut through anything.

And he had even created things that could defy gravity.

None of it was easy.

It was dangerous.

But that was why it was so exciting.

Because forgers were never safe. They were always on the edge of danger, waiting to fall into the abyss that was their own power.

But that was also why they were",gpt-3,ai-generated
"Introducing Nyakim Gatwech, a South Sudanese-American model challenging conventional beauty standards and inspiring others to embrace their unique appearance. The 24-year-old fashion icon, now based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, is unapologetically proud of her richly pigmented skin. Routinely gaining over 10,000 likes on her Instagram posts, Gatwech describes herself as representing ""a nation of warriors.""

Not only promoting diversity in the fashion world, Gatwech is also a prominent advocate for Black rights globally. Proudly accepting the title ""Queen of Darkness,"" she asserts, ""Black is bold, black is beautiful, black is gold… Don't let American standards damage your African soul."" She encourages everyone to love their skin, regardless of its color or shade.

Although Gatwech's distinctive beauty is now celebrated, that wasn't always the case. In 2016, an Uber driver shockingly suggested she bleach her skin to which she responded by laughing. Since then, her confidence in her striking appearance has only grown. ""My chocolate is elegant,"" she writes on Instagram.

With her newfound voice promoting self-esteem and empowerment for the Black community, Gatwech's infectious positivity has garnered over 100,000 followers on Instagram. Despite the occasional negative comment, she continues to radiate self-love, joyfully embracing her title as the ""Queen of the Dark."" Gatwech confidently proclaims, ""My skin absorbs the sun's rays, and my hair defies gravity. Now you can't tell me I'm not magical!""",gpt-4,ai-generated
"Last week, fraternities near the University of Maryland were forced to suspend all activities after the death of a student.

Now, the university has indefinitely suspended all Greek life on campus.

The university is investigating the death of 19-year-old sophomore Jordan Hankins, who was found unresponsive in her dorm room on Monday.

The school says Hankins was not a member of any Greek organization, but her death has prompted the university to suspend all fraternities and sororities while they investigate.

In a statement, university president Wallace Loh said, ""Fraternities and sororities at the University of Maryland have a long and proud history. However, the serious concerns arising from the death of one of our students require that we take decisive action.""

Loh said the university will be conducting a ""thorough review"" of Greek life on campus and that they will be working with students, staff, and alumni to determine the future of Greek organizations at Maryland.

This is the second time in the past year that Greek life has been suspended at the university. In December, the university suspended all Greek life after the death of a student who was also not a member of a Greek organization.

This decision comes after a series of high-profile deaths in Greek life across the country. In March, the University of Cincinnati suspended all Greek life after the death of a student who was also not a member of a Greek organization.

And in November, the University of Oklahoma suspended all Greek life after the death of a student who was also not a member of a Greek organization.

This decision by the University of Maryland follows the lead of other universities across the country, who are responding to the spate of deaths in Greek life by suspending all activities.

The decision by the University of Maryland is likely to cause a lot of backlash from Greek life on campus. Greek life at the university is a big part of the social life on campus, and many students are likely to feel that their presence is being unnecessarily restricted.

There is also the question of whether or not Greek life is really to blame for the death of Jordan Hankins. It is possible that Hankins died from a genuine medical issue, and that her death has nothing to do with her involvement in Greek life.

Overall, this decision by the University of Maryland is a step in the right direction, and it is hopefully the start of a long-term change in the way that Greek life is conducted",gpt-3,ai-generated

"A joint study conducted by researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Wisconsin, Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, and Archaeological Survey of India, has found that India's famous landmark, the Taj Mahal, is slowly turning brownish-yellow due to air pollution. The study states that the color change is caused by the deposition of dust and carbon-containing particles emitted from the burning of fossil fuels, biomass, and garbage.

The research findings could lead to targeted strategies to reduce air pollution in and around Agra, as well as the development of more effective ways to clean the marble surface of the iconic 366-year-old mausoleum, India's most visited man-made structure. Researchers analyzed air samples at the site and found high concentrations of suspended particles that could potentially discolor the monument's surface. The pollutants deposited on the marble were identified as 3% black carbon, around 30% organic carbon (or brown carbon), and the majority being dust.

Black carbon is emitted by vehicles and other machines that burn fossil fuels, while brown carbon is typically released through the burning of biomass and garbage, a common practice in the region. The study concludes that the deposited light-absorbing dust and carbonaceous particles are responsible for the surface discoloration of the Taj Mahal.

Since 2008, efforts have been made to mitigate the yellowing of the monument by using a clay pack treatment consisting of lime-rich Fuller's earth to clean the marble surface. Researchers now plan to study the efficacy of this method and explore ways to improve it, focusing on reversing the yellowing effect caused by air pollution.",gpt-4,ai-generated

 An investigation into the rape conviction of Welsh footballer Ched Evans has been launched by the body investigating possible judicial miscarriages of justice. 
  Evans was convicted in April 2012 of raping a 19-year-old woman at the Premier Inn near Lille, Denbigshire last May.  
 The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) said in October it would speed up the investigation but said it would not disclose why.  
 The investigation could last 35 weeks.

"India's Dalit leader, Mayawati, has called on the Australian government to commit WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to a ""mental asylum"" following leaked US cables revealing that the politician sent an empty jet to Mumbai to collect a pair of sandals. The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, notorious for her lavishness and self-importance, was enraged by the October 2008 WikiLeaks cable titled ""Portrait of a Lady,"" which also alleged that her concerns over security led her to hire food tasters.

Rather than directing her anger towards the US embassy, she targeted the Australian-born WikiLeaks chief, accusing him of being anti-Dalit. Mayawati stated, ""The owner of WikiLeaks has gone mad, or he has joined hands with our opposition parties to malign my government."" She continued, ""I request the government of his country to send him to a mental asylum, and in case they are all full, I will make space for him in the mental asylum in Agra.""

Assange responded by suggesting Mayawati had ""betrayed rational thought."" He demanded an apology and encouraged her to voice her complaints to then-US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. However, he also mentioned that after being under house arrest in the UK for 272 days, he ""would be happy to accept asylum, political asylum, in India – a nation I love."" He added, ""In return, I will bring Mayawati a range of the finest British footwear.""

"As the clock ticks down to the momentous legalization of recreational marijuana in California this January, a flurry of excitement is being generated within the major labor groups. United Food and Commercial Workers, United Farm Workers, and Teamsters are all chomping at the bit to unionize a staggering number of workers involved in the industry - from those who plant the seeds to those who ring up the sales.

With the Golden State's cannabis sector valued at a mind-blowing $22 billion, it's no wonder that these labor groups are eager to establish a foothold in this rapidly growing market. As they gear up for the green wave set to sweep across California, labor leaders can't help but salivate at the prospect of creating 100,000 job opportunities throughout the state.

As January 1st approaches, businesses are scrambling to secure both local permits and state licenses to secure their place in the booming marijuana market, all while keeping a watchful eye on the powerful labor groups surging ahead in establishing a strong presence in the once-taboo industry. The push for unionization signals that the cannabis market, once a hazy pipe dream, has become an incredible and thrilling economic reality.",gpt-4,ai-generated
"In a recent episode of MSNBC's ""AM Joy,"" renowned liberal filmmaker Michael Moore brought to light the alarming reality of sexism and misogyny in our society. Through a captivating anecdote about his conversation with a female Trump supporter, Moore underscored how many women have grown up tolerating inappropriate behavior from men, ultimately normalizing and internalizing these harmful attitudes.

Despite the disheartening situation, actor and comedian John Leguizamo provided a powerful call to action, urging us to recognize and confront the deep-seated sexism and misogyny that persist in contemporary society. The fact that 46% of female voters and 53% of white female voters supported Trump is a sobering reminder of the vital work that lies ahead to dismantle these oppressive structures.

Now is the time for us to come together, amplify our voices, and challenge the systemic barriers that continue to perpetuate such destructive beliefs and attitudes. By engaging in open and honest conversations, and advocating for change, we can pave the way for a more equitable and inclusive future for all.",gpt-4,ai-generated
"Lee Bains III & The Glory Fires are set to take the Sloss Furnaces stage by storm this Sunday, marking the inaugural Sloss Fest in Birmingham, Alabama. With three stages of music, arts, food, and drinks, the event promises to offer a fantastic time for attendees.<!--more-->

Lee Bains III is no stranger to the Birmingham music scene having performed at a plethora of venues throughout the city with his band The Glory Fires as well as previous projects.

Ahead of the event, Lee recently spoke about the band’s activities since their 2014 record ""Dereconstructed"" and what fans can expect from the upcoming album.

Regarding the band’s summer, Lee explained that they will take it easy as far as touring goes for a while. Instead, they will focus their attention on writing new songs and figuring out how to parlay them into a full-band arrangement.

The band’s first two albums span across the spectrum from mellow songs to full-throttle rock. In response to what fans can expect from their new album, Lee noted that he is letting the songs take their unique path to see how they play out.

Reflecting on his adolescence through his early 20s, Lee explains how he grew energised by music at that time, which is now informing their new tracks.

Most excitingly, the band plans to perform some of their new material at the Sloss Fest this weekend. When asked about his expectations for the festival and whether it will emulate the fantastic cross-section of Birgmingham that City Stages did, Lee explained the difficulties of the previous festival over the past few years. However, he believes that Sloss Fest has the potential to become Birmingham's new festival for the residents, where they can come together in a single cross-sectional experience.

Overall, the festival is set to be incredible for all who attend, with a varied combination of arts, food, drinks, and music. Lee Bains III & The Glory Fires look forward to rock the stage with their fantastic performance, which promises to be a celebration of Birmingham’s music scene.",chatgpt,ai-generated
"After the recent UK election, Remainers are now looking for ways to influence the upcoming Brexit negotiations. Former ministers and lobby groups are making moves to ensure their voices are heard. One option being considered is forming a commission or group of advisers from different political parties and businesses, to work towards a more open approach.

Senior Tories, including the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, have also commented that a Conservative Brexit is not enough. But even ministers who support Brexit understand that a minority government has to behave differently, and take a more consensual approach.

While the government may push for a softer stance and try to maximise access to the single market, leaving the single market is unlikely to be reversed; as both major parties supported this during the election process. Also, politicians are not likely to backtrack on their promises to end free movement, since over 80% of the public voted for parties that support this.

The DUP may have an influence in government, but they are not “soft” Brexiteers and will not work towards watering down the Brexit process. However, the government is aware of the need to listen to other parties more since it is now more vulnerable to Eurosceptic backbenchers.

It is not yet clear if the government will establish a cross-party Brexit commission. While a commission such as this could help Theresa May’s appearance of inclusivity, it is uncertain if it will actually achieve its goals since similar committees in the past have not accomplished much.

Although Theresa May may be more vulnerable to other parties, she is not prone to reaching out. Cross-party working will be a key feature of the government, but it will take time to find out how it is executed, and whether a new process will be introduced.",chatgpt,ai-generated
"In a recent interview with News Real Blog, Rep. Ron Paul shared his views on America's Israel policy, and his attitude towards the Jewish state was particularly prominent. Paul argued that Israel is under threat as America is always there, and their policies only impose greater threats upon them. Since they expect U.S. intervention if they do not follow their regulations, the congressman believes that they consider America more of a threat than any military power. Moreover, with 300 nuclear weapons, Israel is a virtually untouchable power. 

It seems evident from the interview that the congressman's comments on the matter were somewhat ignorant. In fact, he believes that the U.S. should treat all countries equally and be friends with all of them. However, it is unlikely that this will be accepted as a viable strategy to voters. For instance, treating Canada the same way as North Korea would not help the U.S. gain any political advantage. 

Furthermore, most Americans do not agree with Rep. Paul's view on the Israel issue. According to a Gallup poll released the other day, more than four times as many U.S. citizens prefer Israel over Palestine. Conservatives, in particular, offer enhanced support for Israel; this does not bode well for Paul's likelihood to win the Republican Primary in 2012. 

In short, while Rep. Paul may have certain views about U.S. foreign policy that sound noble, it is doubtful whether they will gain much support amongst the masses. In any case, it is important to take all factors into account before deciding on a particular foreign policy.",chatgpt,ai-generated

"2009-07-09, 4:45 The third test's concluding moments were marred by controversy, but who ultimately had a say in the pivotal choice that had players and commentators baffled? Minute 78. 15-15. Penalty Blacks all. Both the game and the series are on the line. Now comes inspector Poite and Jrme Garcs, his dependable companion. Poite has the last say, but as the video below demonstrates, his first judgment was overruled after consulting with the TMO and was awarded an All Black penalty after a little trip back. Whatever your opinion of the call, it's intriguing that Poite seems to have been persuaded by a brief conversation with the linesman who was standing on the incorrect side of the ground. Mr. Garcs. After in-depth discussion with his TMO, Poite decides that penalizing Owens for unintentional offside is the proper course of action. Right or wrong, he has come to the conclusion that the Lions should be given a penalty that might decide the game. He starts to explain the choice to Read and Warburton when Garces' headset interrupts him. I think the phrase ""Oui Jerome?"" roughly translates to ""Yeah Jerome?"" The brief chat, which we are unable to hear, is one-sided. The intervention results in Poite's initial decision to impose a punishment being overturned. What was said by Garces, and why did it affect Poite's choice? Read and the pundits are perplexed by the ""bargain,"" as Poite puts it, but Warburton appears relieved as he signals for a scrum. There is a case to be made that Read was offside at the kickoff or impeded Williams in the air, and everyone will have their own judgment. They are unimportant. What did Garces say to Poite and why did it affect his decision? That is the query I would love to have answered.

"In the Philadelphia suburb of West Chester, Pennsylvania, an alleged prostitute and her male accomplice were arrested for robbing a home after the customer did not pay for sexual services. Monica DeJesus, 22, and Justin Harris, 36, are now in custody at Chester County jail facing multiple charges, including robbery, conspiracy, and the promotion of prostitution.

According to Philly.com, the incident occurred when DeJesus and Harris went to the residence in East Goshen Township around 5:30 a.m. on Sunday. It is reported that the pair decided to rob the house as a form of retaliation. Harris, armed with a gun, forcefully kicked in the door to gain entry, only to be overpowered by one of the two residents inside. The resident managed to defend himself, striking Harris in the face with a fireplace poker. 

At this point, DeJesus took over the situation, picking up the dropped gun and pointing it at the same resident, while the other managed to run away before any harm could come to them. Despite the dangerous encounter, the duo managed to take away some unspecified property from the home.

Following the incident, police were able to locate and apprehend the couple a short time later. Both suspects were found with the stolen gun and other property taken from the residence. Chester County jail will hold DeJesus and Harris until their trial, with court records not yet showing listings for defense attorneys.

"President Obama might soon face an increasingly challenging situation concerning the necessary funding for an anticipated surge of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Recent comments made by House Appropriations Chairman David Obey serve as clear evidence of the mounting conflict surrounding this issue.

In an interview with ABC News, Obey issued a warning to Obama, stating, ""There won't be any money available for other crucial programs if we invest everything into Afghanistan. If the administration asks for an increased commitment of troops, I will push for them to provide financing for it."" Obey’s strong position on this matter exposes the emerging disagreement between various entities.

This tension arises at a critical time when the Obama administration is already experiencing pressure from Democrats in Congress to boost federal spending, in the hope of stimulating job growth within the country. However, according to the Wall Street Journal, the Obama administration shows a preference for adopting ""targeted measures that would be less likely to inflate the deficit."" This approach demonstrates their effort to balance the demands of the ongoing war with domestic economic concerns.

Additionally, an ongoing debate persists over the actual cost of deploying more troops in Afghanistan. Recently, the LA Times reported that the estimates provided by the Obama administration and the Pentagon significantly differ. According to the Pentagon's original calculations, the cost would be $500,000 per year for each service member, bringing the total additional expense to an estimated $20 billion per year if General Stanley A. McChrystal's request for 40,000 more troops is approved.

In stark contrast, the White House has recently doubled that figure, placing the cost at $1 million for each new soldier deployed, as stated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Interestingly, the LA Times points out that a Pentagon comptroller's recent calculations came much closer to the OMB's higher estimate than the Pentagon's initial budgeting. This inconsistency further fuels the discussion regarding the feasibility and financial impact of expanding military resources in Afghanistan.

In conclusion, the mounting debate over funding the expected buildup of U.S. troops in Afghanistan places President Obama in a difficult position, forcing him to balance the concerns of various factions while maintaining focus on domestic issues such as job growth and economic stability.",gpt-4,ai-generated

"Pepsin: A Comprehensive Overview

Pepsin is an essential digestive enzyme in the stomach that helps break down proteins into smaller peptides. It is produced by the chief cells of the gastric glands in the stomach and is one of the leading endopeptidases present in the digestive systems of humans and many other animals. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of pepsin, including its structure, digestion function, history, precursor, activity and stability, role in laryngopharyngeal reflux, storage, and inhibitors.

Structure and Digestion Function of Pepsin

Pepsin has a three-dimensional structure comprising one or more polypeptide chains that twist and fold to form an active site, which is the location on the enzyme where the substrate binds and the reaction takes place. As an aspartic protease, pepsin uses a catalytic aspartate in its active site. It is one of the three principal proteases present in the human digestive system, the other two being chymotrypsin and trypsin. These enzymes work together to break down dietary proteins into their components, such as peptides and amino acids, which can be easily absorbed by the small intestine. Pepsin is most active in cleaving peptide bonds between hydrophobic and preferably aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine.

History of Pepsin

Pepsin was discovered in 1836 by Theodor Schwann, making it one of the first enzymes to be discovered. The name ""pepsin"" was derived from the Greek word ""pepsis,"" meaning digestion. Scientists around this time began discovering many biochemical compounds that play a significant role in biological processes, and pepsin was one of them. An acidic substance that could convert nitrogen-based foods into water-soluble material was identified as pepsin.

 precursor of Pepsin

Pepsin is synthesized as a zymogen called pepsinogen, which has an additional 44 amino acids. In the stomach, chief cells release pepsinogen, which is then activated by the hydrochloric acid (HCl) released from the parietal cells in the stomach lining. The hormone gastrin and the vagus nerve trigger the release of pepsinogen and HCl from the stomach lining when food is ingested. The hydrochloric acid creates an acidic environment that allows pepsinogen to unfold and cleave itself in an autocatalytic fashion, thereby generating pepsin, the active form.

Activity and stability of Pepsin

Pepsin is most active at a pH of 1.5 to 2 and can digest up to 20% of ingested amide bonds. Pepsin cleaves preferentially at the C-terminal side of aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. It is inactive at a pH of 6.5 and above but is not fully denatured or irreversibly inactivated until pH 8.0. Pepsin is also unstable at high pH, which has significant implications for laryngopharyngeal reflux disease. Pepsin molecules remaining in the larynx following a gastric reflux event could be reactivated, resulting in damage to the local tissues.

Role of Pepsin in Laryngopharyngeal Reflux

Pepsin is one of the primary causes of mucosal damage during laryngopharyngeal reflux, which occurs when stomach acid and/or content flows back to the larynx and pharynx. Pepsin molecules that remain in the larynx following a gastric reflux event remain stable but could potentially be reactivated, as noted above. Reactive pepsin causes inflamed and irritated tissues in the larynx, leading to the impaired laryngeal immune response.

Storage of Pepsin

Pepsin should be stored at very low temperatures (between -80 °C and -20 °C) to prevent autolysis, which is self-digestion.

Inhibitors of Pepsin

Pepsin can be inhibited by high pH, which disrupts enzymatic activity, or by specific inhibitor compounds. Pepstatin is a low molecular weight and potent inhibitor that is specific to acid proteases with a Ki of about 10−10 M for pepsin. Pepstatin's analog for the transition state for catalysis by pepsin and other acid proteases is responsible for pepstatin's inhibition of pepsin.

Conclusion

Pepsin plays a crucial role in the digestive system of humans and many other animals and is one of the first enzymes discovered. The structure, digestion function, history, precursor, activity and stability, role in laryngopharyngeal reflux, storage, and inhibitors of pepsin provide a comprehensive understanding of the enzyme. Understanding pepsin's role in digestive processes and related disorders is essential in developing therapeutic interventions for related diseases like laryngopharyngeal reflux.",chatgpt,ai-generated
"Now that the ""alt-right,"" as personified by Stephen Bannon, is in the White House, conservative leaders are attempting to determine where it fits within the larger movement. MARYLAND'S NATIONAL HARBOR Donald Trump put an end to the movement conservatism. What other way to explain the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference? During the 2016 Republican presidential nomination race, many self-described conservatives declared that Trump was not one of their number. The American Conservative Union (ACU), which sponsors the annual CPAC conference, celebrated the Trump administration from the main stage on Thursday, featuring the administration's top figures in various formats, including a rare public interview with chief White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon, the ""economic nationalist"" who prides himself on providing ""the platform for the 'alt-right'"" during his tenure as CEO of Breitbart News. The term ""alt-right"" refers to a group of hate groups and their leaders who openly declare white supremacy, misogyny, homophobia, Islamophobia, and/or anti-Semitism as part of their ideology. Since Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential bid, movement conservatism has attempted to express those same prejudices through the language of such grand philosophical principles as individual liberty, the beauty of small government, and the moral hazard of allowing government to keep poor people from going hungry. Trump and his advisers were astute in recognizing that the same fuel of rage and resentment that animated conservatism no longer required those ideological trappings and could be channeled in the service of the businessman's ideologically squishy presidential campaign. Trump and his advisers were astute in recognizing that the same fuel of rage and resentment that animated conservatism no longer required those ideological trappings and could be channeled in the service of the businessman's ideologically squishy presidential campaign. Throughout the campaign, Trump retweeted posts from white supremacist accounts, amplifying smears against African-Americans and others and engaging voters outside the ""alt-right"" pool by normalizing the movement's rhetoric. Conservatives are eager to claim Trump's victory as their own, if this year's CPAC is any indication. (On the first day of the conference, Bannon appeared alongside Trump's chief of staff Reince Priebus, Vice President Mike Pence, presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway, and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.) But now that the ""alt-right,"" as personified by Bannon, is in the White House, conservative leaders are on pins and needles, trying to figure out where the ""alt-right"" fits into the larger movement. Just hours before ACU Chairman Matt Schlapp met with Bannon and Priebus, ACU Executive Director Dan Schneider declared that the term ""alt-right"" had been ""hijacked"" by a ""left-wing fascist group."" ""They stole the term specifically to confuse us,"" he added. Schneider was referring to the white nationalist National Policy Institute (NPI), which is led by Richard B. Spencer. ""They met just a few months ago in Washington, DC, to spew their hatred and give their 'Heil Hitler' salutes,"" Schneider explained. (He failed to mention that attendees at the NPI's Nov. 19 conference raised their arms in support of Trump, hardly a left-winger.) An hour later, Spencer arrived at CPAC, where a show was made of escorting him off the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center, where the conference is being held, but only after he was allowed to hold court with journalists for more than 30 minutes, according to Bloomberg News' Jennifer Jacobs. The truth is that, with Bannon's appointment as White House strategist, the ""alt-right"" is where the energy is today in right-wing circles. But even before CPAC's opening session, the American Conservative Union had an ""alt-right"" problem, one of its own making, when it abruptly announced the addition of right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos as a conference keynoter, then just as abruptly rescinded the invitation when a video went viral showing Yiannopoulos endorsing the sexual abuse of pubescent boys by Roman Catholic priests. The fact that Yiannopoulos is notorious for outrageous expressions of racism and misogyny was apparently of little concern to CPAC leaders prior to the video. They wanted to bring up the cool kid onstage. The truth is that, with Bannon's appointment as White House strategist, the ""alt-right"" is where the energy is today in right-wing circles. If not Bannon's creation, Yiannopoulos was one of his stars at Breitbart News, the senior editor whom Peter Montgomery of Right Wing Watch described as the right's gay enfant terrible. Yiannopoulos was in charge of writing.",paraphrase,ai-generated
"As the golden era of Matt Smith's Doctor comes to a close, a thrilling and mysterious new chapter awaits us with Peter Capaldi stepping into the iconic role. The anticipation is palpable, as the winds of change begin to swirl through the Whoniverse.

Smith's Doctor held much in common with his predecessor, Tennant, their mutual approach to crisis and fury intertwined like cosmic fraternal twins. Yet, whispers from the depths of BBC suggest that Capaldi's portrayal promises to be a stunning departure from what we've seen before - a fresh regeneration in more ways than one.

Capaldi, renowned for breathing life into delightfully cranky and provocative characters (a notable example being his performance in ""In The Loop""), may very well imbue his Doctor with similar traits. But how would such a fiery personality dance with our dear Clara? Only time (and time travel) will tell.

Trailers for the new series tantalize with snippets of what's to come. One striking image features the Tardis caught in a fiery explosion, a dramatic, yet not unheard of, occurrence in recent years. The true enigma, however, lies within a haunting voice that echoes through the trailer. Could it be the sinister tones of Davros? Or merely another Dalek set on destruction? The chilling words, ""I see into your soul Doctor. I see beauty, divinity... hatred!"" resonate with a poetry that seems tailored for Davros himself. Further conversations hint at the Time War, leaving us to ponder who else in this cosmic playground possesses such power to evoke those emotions in our beloved Doctor.

Our curiosity is further piqued by a seemingly symbolic shot of the Doctor's dual hearts. Cinematic flair or foreshadowing? The notion of yet another regeneration so soon sends shivers down our spines. The answers await us in the depths of time as the journey begins anew, and the Tardis takes flight once more.",gpt-4,ai-generated

"Meridian Police Ask Public for Help in Finding Missing Man

Meridian police issued a public appeal on Tuesday night for any information regarding the whereabouts of 55-year-old Mark Allen Rose. His Chevrolet pickup was reportedly discovered positioned along the Boise River when he failed to arrive for work on Monday morning.

At approximately 6:00 a.m., Rose left his Meridian home en route to his job assignment at Nampa. However, after not showing up for work, his family became worried and contacted the police to report him missing.

As they expressed their concern, Rose’s family told officials that he has been struggling with depression, a factor that led them to redouble their efforts in searching for him. The police issued an alert for Rose and his gray 2004 Chevrolet pickup with Plate number 1A8005X.

The Meridian police soon widened their search to areas near Boise River and notified the Canyon County Sheriff’s Office of Rose’s possible disappearance. A short while later, the authorities found the man’s vehicle at a sportsman’s access along the Boise River at 21319 Midland Boulevard.

Despite the use of a tracking dog, the Canyon County Sheriff’s Office in a statement, said that the dog “lost the scent after a short time”. This prompted the police to request the assistance of anyone with information about Rose’s whereabouts to come forward to aid in their search efforts.

Mark Allen Rose is described as 5ft 10 inches tall, weighing 150 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes. He was last seen wearing khakis, a gray shirt and blue fleece jacket. If you have any information or had any contact with Rose on Monday, it is requested that you call the Meridian police at 888-6678.",chatgpt,ai-generated
"The Minnesota Gophers have successfully secured the commitment of Martez Shabazz, a junior-college cornerback from Trinity Valley Community College in Texas. Originally, Shabazz had chosen Baylor University, but switched to Minnesota due to academic constraints.

Shabazz shared that Baylor University would not accept some of his lower grades, which meant he would have had to take additional classes to be eligible to play for the school. Unfortunately, financial limitations made that option unfeasible for Shabazz. He then contacted Minnesota, who gladly accepted his commitment.

Despite his academic challenges, Shabazz, known to be one of the fastest junior college defenders, expressed enthusiasm about joining the Gophers. Coach Jerry Kill envisions utilizing Shabazz's talents on blitzes and coverage plays, similar to LSU's Tyrann Mathieu. Shabazz is eagerly looking forward to proving himself and taking advantage of the opportunity to play in the Big Ten.

Coach Kill has a reputation for being cautious with junior college transfers, especially those who have faced academic issues. Nonetheless, it appears that he is willing to work with Shabazz to help him overcome his academic struggles. Though college coaches are unable to comment on recruits until they sign letters of intent, it seems that Kill is confident in Shabazz's abilities and potential. As such, he has communicated with Shabazz daily and even plans to visit him in Texas.

Minnesota will benefit from the addition of Shabazz, who brings his undeniable talent to a program that is eager to bounce back from a 3-9 season. Shabazz's journey with the Gophers is sure to be one worth watching.",gpt-4,ai-generated
"The Anglican Church in Uganda recently announced plans to construct a museum at the Uganda Martyrs Heritage Centre in Namugongo, a township in Central Uganda. The project, which will be run by the Chairman of the Project, the Archbishop Emeritus of Uganda, Livingstone Mpalanyi Nkoyoyo, aims to develop the entire Martyrs Heritage Centre where the first seed of Christianity was sown in Uganda, possibly in East Africa, and the whole of Africa during the reign of King Mwanga Basammula 11.

The goal of the project is to provide “empirical information on the Uganda martyrs with the construction of a one-stop centre in which information can be obtained on issues related to the martyrs.” The proposed museum is expected to create a national and international tourist centre, honouring the brave men who were killed and depicting the rich religious and cultural values of Uganda.

The estimated cost of the project is approximately $14m. Due to the large amount of money required to complete the project, the construction will be carried out in justifiable phases so as not to exhaust willing contributors. According to Archbishop Emeritus Nkoyoyo, the project’s first phase will begin with the main killing area, including a big shelter estimated at approximately $800,000, that will house the command post of the Chief Executioner of the prison where the convicts were kept before they were killed. Additionally, the shelter will house the firewood spot where dry firewood was kept in readiness to burn the convicts and the tree to which the convicts were tied and dismembered.

The facility will also have a burning spot where the convicts were burnt to death and the Martyrs Memorial Church where the remains of the martyrs are kept. The second phase of the ambitious project will include the construction of a three-storey building to accommodate offices, religious and cultural artifacts, a resource centre, and a library. The third phase of the project will cover a children’s recreation centre, a 100-room self-contained guest house, a multipurpose recreational ground, and a perimeter wall for security. The group will also improve the worship site where the Martyrs Day Services are conducted and work on the Uganda martyrs well and a facility for bottling the water.

The current Archbishop of the Anglican Church in Uganda, the Most Revd Stanley Ntagali is supportive of the development committee’s plan. Archbishop Emeritus Nkoyoyo has called on Christians worldwide and other well-wishers to contribute and help realise this ambitious project, which aims to help invigorate the conservation and appreciation of Uganda’s rich religious heritage among all ages.

"IQ scale What is the IQ test used to measure? What is a typical score? How high can IQ scores go? Here are some responses to these questions and others. Initially, the notion of IQ was either created in 1912 by the German psychologist and philosopher Wilhelm Stern or in 1916 by Lewis Terman, depending on the source you examine. Before either of these dates, intelligence testing was conducted on a significant scale for the first time. In 1904, the French government commissioned the psychologist Alfred Binet to develop a test to distinguish between intellectually normal and substandard children. The IQ scale known as the ""Binet Scale"" (and later the ""Simon-Binet Scale"") was derived from Binet's research. Later, the term ""intelligence quotient"" or ""IQ"" entered our lexicon. Terman improved the Simon-Binet IQ Scale and released the Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon Intelligence Scale in 1916. (also known as the Stanford-Binet). The resulting scale for classifying IQ scores is as follows: IQ Scale Above 140 - Genius or practically genius 120 - 140 - Extremely superior intelligence 110 - 119 - Excellent intelligence 90 - 109 - Average or average intellect 80 - 89 - Dullness 70 - 79 - Borderline impairment in intellect Under 70 - Feeble-mindedness Distribution Normale des Cotes IQ 50% of IQ scores range from 90 to 110 70% of IQ scores range from 85 to 115 95% of IQ scores range from 70 to 130 99.5% of IQ values range from 60 to 140 Low IQ and Mental Deficit A quotient of intelligence below 70 is called ""mental retardation"" or poor mental capacity. In IQ tests, 5% of the population scores below 70. Typically, the severity of mental retardation is divided into four levels: 50-70 - Mild mental retardation (85%) 35-50 - Moderate mental retardation (10%) 20-35 - Severe mental retardation (4%) IQ 20 - Severe intellectual disability (1%) Superior IQ & Genius IQ A genius or near-genius IQ begins at approximately 140 to 145. Fewer than one-fourth of one percent belong to this category. Below are some popular IQ scale designations: 115-124 - Over average 125-134 - Gifted 135-144 - Extremely gifted 145-164 - Genius 165-179 - High genius 180-200 - Highest genius",paraphrase,ai-generated
"Recently, the Guardian took the decision to cut down the number of places where we open comments on stories relating to a few contentious subjects – particularly migration and race.

We hope it'll help us to be responsible hosts, essentially. 
  We expect a great deal of our commenters, and we try to hold them to some specific standards.

It's not hard to see the value there.

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott's proposal to revoke sole Australian citizenship from individuals implicated in terrorism has encountered strong resistance within his cabinet. The proposal has been criticized for potentially violating international law by removing a person's citizenship without due process and possibly rendering them stateless. As per the proposal's stipulations, the only safeguard against leaving an Australian stateless would be to ensure that they are eligible to apply for another country's citizenship, regardless of their current dual citizenship status. Notably, a related proposal allowing the removal of Australian citizenship from dual citizens under suspicions of terrorism has been accepted.

Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop raised concerns regarding the potential difficulties imposed on individuals seeking citizenship in another country after being stripped of their Australian citizenship due to terrorism suspicions. Attorney-General George Brandis, who was present at the cabinet meeting, reportedly affirmed his commitment to the rule of law, stating, ""I am the Attorney-General. It is my job to stand for the rule of law."" Furthermore, Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce questioned the necessity of the proposal, asking, ""Isn't that what we have courts for?""

Owing to the discord within the cabinet's national security committee, the proposal was included only as part of a ""discussion paper"" and was not put forth as a proposed legislation.

He refused to speak it so he could get out of prison and have a life. He then repeated his 34-year-old claim: I didn't do this. A lifetime later, people listen. After years of study and analysis, the Innocence Project at the University of British Columbia has gained Mr. Tallio the opportunity to appeal his 1983 conviction for the murder of his 22-month-old cousin, Delavina Mack, over three decades after the appeal deadline.

"Title: Ballard Multimodal Corridor Update

Article:

The Ballard Multimodal corridor includes several transportation projects along NW Market St and Shilshole Ave NW, aiming to enhance accessibility and improve transportation efficiency. The proposed upgrades in the area include roadway paving, signal improvements, new transit poles, sidewalk construction, storm drainage improvements, and the completion of the Burke-Gilman Trail Missing Link.

The Ballard Multimodal Corridor will undergo improvements in two distinct phases - the Market and Shilshole phases. Construction on the Market phase, between the Ballard Locks and 24th Ave NW, will commence in mid-2019 and progress through the year. Utility verification for the Market Phase is set to begin in March 2019.

The utility verification work for the transit poles and signal improvements is expected to start in early March, concluding in May. One lane of NW Market St and NW 54th St will be closed for exploratory excavations during this period. The work will help determine potential locations for King County Metro transit poles and Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) signal poles, with some pavement removal and vegetation clearing required.

The Ballard Multimodal corridor comes as a result of consultations with various community stakeholders, focusing on creating a multimodal corridor along the Ship Canal between the Ballard Locks and 11th Ave NW. The upgraded infrastructure aims to benefit various road users, including pedestrians, cyclists, and truck drivers. 

The extensive history of the Burke-Gilman Trail Project has involved extensive community outreach and environmental review processes to ensure that the improvements are well-suited to the needs of local residents. The project focuses on enhancing the safety and predictability for all road users, while promoting efficient usage of public funding through partnerships with other projects and agencies.

The construction of the Ballard Multimodal Corridor is anticipated to be completed by the end of 2020, with overall costs projected to be approximately $26.4 million. Funding for these improvements will come from a variety of partnerships and programs, combining efforts to provide a more efficient and safe transportation experience for the Ballard community.",gpt-4,ai-generated
"Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Governor, Raghuram Rajan, has expressed concerns over the rise of crowdfunding in India, as investors aim to discover the next Alibaba or Facebook. Crowdfunding is attracting increasing attention in the country; however, Rajan has warned that as this method of raising capital gains traction, it could lead to regulatory challenges and issues with fund recovery if and when businesses fail. 

During the State Bank of India Banking and Economics Conclave, Rajan shared his concerns, stating, ""One of my worries about crowdfunding is when it works, it’s good, but when you have to recover (the important questions are) who recovers and how does it happen, especially in an environment where enforcement is difficult."" 

Crowdfunding is currently defined by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) as the collection of funds from multiple investors through web-based platforms for specific creative projects, business ventures, or social causes. The challenge, however, lies in how crowdfunding is conducted, with regulators voicing concerns over the lack of protection and safeguards for retail investors. 

While investments backed by venture capitalists or private equity are protected within a company's management and board, this level of security is absent for retail investors participating in crowdfunding. Instances of defaults, frauds, and lack of documentation leave these investors vulnerable, with virtually no means of recovering their money if the funding platform suddenly closes down. Notable Indian crowdfunding platforms include TheHot-Start.com, Indiegogo.com, and wishberry.in.",gpt-4,ai-generated
"On Tuesday, the Indian Cabinet failed to approve the controversial National Sports Development Bill, which faced strong opposition from ministers heading sports bodies. The bill aimed to rein in sports federations and possibly gain governmental control over the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The Cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, explored several objections to the bill, leading to the decision that the sports ministry should re-work the bill before it can be reconsidered.

The National Sports Development Bill, steered by Sports Minister Ajay Maken, faced opposition primarily based on issues related to preserving the autonomy of sports organizations and age restriction for sports administrators. Among the opponents of the bill were Sharad Pawar, former BCCI chief and current ICC president; Farooq Abdullah, president of the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association; C P Joshi, President of Rajasthan Cricket Association; and Vilasrao Deshmukh, president of the Mumbai Cricket Association. Other ministers opposing the bill included Praful Patel, chief of the All India Football Federation; Kapil Sibal; and Kamal Nath. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Home Minister P Chidambaram were reportedly in favor of the bill.

Originally, the bill sought to make revolutionary changes in the functioning of sports bodies across the nation, including imposing an age limit of 70 years and tenure restrictions for administrators, as well as bringing these bodies under the Right to Information (RTI) Act. However, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and multiple other National Sports Federations vehemently opposed the bill, asserting that it constituted an attempt to interfere with the functioning of the organizations.

Additionally, the IOA stated that the move contravened the Olympic charter, potentially resulting in India being banned from international sports events if the government attempted to curb sports organizations' autonomy. Cricket administrators also raised concerns regarding the proposed bill, which aimed to place the BCCI under the purview of the RTI.

Had the Cabinet approved the bill, it could have affected the tenures of several seasoned administrators such as Suresh Kalmadi, V K Malhotra, Yashwant Sinha, Jagdish Tytler, and Virendra Nanavati, who have led their respective federations for decades. The bill could also have brought the cash-rich BCCI under its jurisdiction, although cricket administrators maintain that the legislation would not be binding on the board, which does not receive any government grants.

The sports ministry will now make adjustments to the bill, taking into consideration the objections raised by the ministers. As a result, it is unlikely that the bill will be presented during the ongoing session of Parliament. Sports Minister Maken had previously stated that the bill, once passed in Parliament, would enhance accountability in the functioning of the National Sports Federations.",gpt-4,ai-generated

"Girl's Day, the popular girl group, is embarking on a new journey. According to their entertainment agency, Dream Tea, the group will be travelling to Thailand on August 17 to work as honorary ambassadors for Plan Korea. The international child support organization is dedicated to raising awareness about girls' human rights and supporting the advancement of young girls worldwide.

This is not the first time that Girl's Day has participated in Plan Korea's volunteer program. They volunteered in Thailand last August and were actively involved in helping young girls who were married off at a young age and were victims of domestic violence. The group was commended for their hard work and dedication towards their cause.

Plan Korea is delighted to have Girl's Day participate in their volunteer program once again. This time, the pop singers will be meeting four little girls who do not have birth certificates. The lack of certificates poses significant challenges for these young girls, as it makes it difficult for them to access basic education and healthcare facilities.

Girl's Day will work alongside Plan Korea to help the four little girls acquire birth certificates so that they can access essential services. The group's efforts will enable these girls to experience a life of dignity and respect.

In conclusion, Girl's Day is committed to making a difference in the lives of young girls who struggle with hardships. Their involvement with Plan Korea is a testament to their belief in and dedication towards promoting girls' human rights. Their work with Plan Korea is inspiring and serves as a reminder of the positive impact that celebrities can have by using their platform for worthy causes.",chatgpt,ai-generated
"The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) and Mayor Rahm Emanuel are working diligently to secure funding for the Red and Purple Modernization Project (RPM) before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. It is anticipated that support for urban transit projects may become harder to come by under the new administration, considering Trump's electoral base comprises mostly of rural and suburban residents, many of whom are not inclined towards public transit. Additionally, Trump has chosen a road lobbyist to lead his transportation transition team.

State legislation passed recently allows Chicago to create tax-increment districts for four specific transit projects. Unlike conventional TIF districts, this new legislation prohibits the transit TIF zones from diverting any funding away from Chicago Public Schools. Under the Obama administration, it is likely that the U.S. Department of Transportation would provide $1 billion in funding to cover 50% of the RPM project cost. This could be granted through a ""Core Capacity"" grant, a funding source established for expanding capacity on pre-existing transit systems.

As part of the RPM project, the CTA plans to rebuild the Red and Purple Line tracks between Lawrence and Bryn Mawr in Phase 1 and extend from Bryn Mawr to Howard in a future phase. In the first phase, signal upgrades and the construction of a flyover track north of the Belmont station would take place, which would help eliminate conflicts between Red, Purple, and Brown Line trains, thus increasing capacity. Additionally, the CTA would rebuild four stations: Lawrence, Argyle, Berwyn, and Bryn Mawr.

While Trump has not explicitly stated that he would cut transit funding, his transportation policies remain ambiguous. Although the official Republican party platform calls for the federal government to cease funding transit, Trump has not committed to this. He has mentioned intentions to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure over a decade, encompassing all types of transportation. However, politicians and experts have expressed doubts about the feasibility of his proposed funding mechanism.

The CTA would be eligible for Core Capacity funding if it submits an application by November 30. The RPM transit TIF district is projected to generate approximately $623 million over its 35-year lifespan, which would be used to repay a federal loan covering matching funds for the $1 billion Core Capacity grant. The improved transit service created by the RPM project would increase property values in surrounding neighborhoods, generating additional property tax revenue.

In compliance with the transit TIF law, the Chicago Public Schools would receive the same portion of this additional revenue as they would if the transit TIF district did not exist. The transit TIF would receive 80% of the remaining increment money, with other taxing bodies receiving 20%.

However, before the CTA can submit its funding application for the RPM project by the November 30 deadline, approval for the transit TIF from three local authorities is required. The Community Development Commission will hold a meeting to approve the TIF district, followed by the Chicago Plan Commission voting on the proposed transit TIF's approval. Lastly, the City Council's zoning committee will vote on the TIF.

While 43rd Ward alder Michele Smith has opposed the district's boundaries, thousands of daily CTA commuters living in the area will directly benefit from the improvements. The RPM project would enhance the reliability of transit service north of Belmont, eliminate track-crossing delays with the Belmont flyover, allow the CTA to add more rush-hour trains to alleviate overcrowding, and make four stations ADA accessible, providing new travel options for people with disabilities. The increased reliability, capacity, and accessibility would benefit not only the residents but also merchants along the entire Red Line.

The full City Council's vote on the TIF has not been determined yet. Mayor Emanuel would have to call a special session, as the next regularly scheduled council meeting is imminent.",gpt-4,ai-generated
"Title: PiWall & Infinnovation Ltd: Innovating Video Wall Technology Through Art and Science

PiWall, in collaboration with Infinnovation Ltd, is constantly working on groundbreaking artistic installations, with several projects underway in 2016. While our main focus has shifted towards the art market, we remain dedicated to creating unique video wall displays that go beyond the boundaries of traditional digital signage applications. As a result, we have recently embarked on a joint project aimed at creating our largest PiWall yet, featuring over 200 screens, in association with a highly skilled creative and technical team in London.

In 2015, we were involved in some significant projects and accomplishments, including:

1. Assisting with the deployment of a 70-screen CRT-based wall at the Eaux Claires Festival 2015 in Wisconsin. With the aid of a creative team from New York, we put together a live PiWall that supported several live onstage performances at this prominent arts festival.

"ATLAS: A General-Purpose Particle Detector Experiment

ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) is one of seven particle detector experiments constructed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland. The ATLAS experiment was one of the two LHC experiments involved in the discovery of the Higgs boson, a missing piece of the Standard Model of Particle Physics, in July 2012. The experiment is designed to observe phenomena that involve highly massive particles, which were not observable using earlier lower-energy accelerators. 

The ATLAS detector is a collaboration involving roughly 3,000 physicists from over 175 institutions in 38 countries. It is 46 meters long, 25 meters in diameter, and weighs about 7,000 tonnes. The experiment has some 3000 km of cable and is designed to take advantage of the unprecedented energy available at the LHC. It was proposed in its current form in 1994 and officially funded by the CERN member countries in 1995. Construction work began at individual institutions, with detector components then being shipped to CERN and assembled in the ATLAS experiment pit, starting in the year 2003. Karl Jakobs leads the project now.

At 27 kilometers in circumference, the LHC collides two beams of protons together, with each proton carrying up to 6.5 TeV of energy - this is enough to produce particles with masses that are significantly greater than any particles currently known, if these particles exist. ATLAS is designed to detect these particles, namely, their masses, momentum, energies, lifetime, charges, and nuclear spins. In order to identify all particles produced at the interaction point where the particle beams collide, the detector is designed in layers made up of detectors of different types, each of which is designed to observe specific types of particles. The different traces that particles leave in each layer of the detector allow for effective particle identification and accurate measurements of energy and momentum. As the energy of the particles produced by the accelerator increases, the detectors attached to it must grow to effectively measure, and stop higher-energy particles. As of 2017, ATLAS is the largest detector ever built at a particle collider.

ATLAS is a general-purpose detector. When the proton beams produced by the Large Hadron Collider interact in the center of the detector, a variety of different particles with a broad range of energies are produced. Rather than focusing on a particular physical process, ATLAS is designed to measure the broadest possible range of signals. This is intended to ensure that whatever form any new physical processes or particles might take, ATLAS will be able to detect them and measure their properties. Experiments at earlier colliders, such as the Tevatron and Large Electron-Positron Collider, were designed based on a similar philosophy. However, the unique challenges of the Large Hadron Collider, its unprecedented energy, and extremely high rate of collisions, require ATLAS to be significantly larger and more complex than previous experiments.

ATLAS investigates many different types of physics that might become detectable in the energetic collisions of the LHC. Some of these are confirmations or improved measurements of the Standard Model, while many others are possible clues for new physical theories. The detection of the Higgs boson was one of the most important goals of ATLAS. The experiments were also able to show that the properties of the particle, as well as the ways it interacts with other particles, were well-matched with those of a Higgs boson, which is expected to have spin 0 and positive parity. In March 2013, the ATLAS project and CMS, its sister experiment, were able to prove that the detected particle was indeed a Higgs boson. Analysis of more properties of the particle and data collected in 2015 and 2016 confirmed this further. 

In conclusion, ATLAS is a critical tool for scientists exploring particle physics beyond the Standard Model. With its unparalleled capacity to measure high-energy particle collisions, it continues to provide knowledge that redefines what we know about our universe.",chatgpt,ai-generated
"New Harvard Study Confirms Cannabis Makes Men Last Longer In Bed 
A new study from Harvard University confirms what many cannabis smokers have been saying for years: cannabis makes men last longer in bed. The study, which was published in the Harvard Medical School blog, found that men who smoke cannabis have a significantly lower risk of premature ejaculation than those who don’t.

The study, which was conducted by Dr. Michael Eisenberg, looked at the data of over 50,000 men from the National Health and Social Life Survey. The data showed that men who reported smoking cannabis had a 34% lower risk of premature ejaculation than those who didn’t.

This is not the first time that cannabis has been linked to improved sexual performance. A study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine in 2014 found that men who used cannabis before sex reported longer lasting erections and increased sexual satisfaction.

So, if you’re looking to improve your sexual performance, it might be worth giving cannabis a try. Just don’t forget to use a condom!

Cannabis and Anxiety

There is a lot of speculation about whether or not cannabis can help treat anxiety disorders, and the answer is that there isn’t a lot of research to support either claim. However, many people believe that cannabis can be a helpful adjunct treatment for anxiety disorders.

Some of the benefits of cannabis for anxiety include:

Reduced stress and anxiety

Reduced inflammation

Reduced pain

Improved sleep

Improved mood

Improved cognitive function

Cannabis has been shown to be a helpful treatment for a variety of conditions, including anxiety disorders. However, there is a lack of rigorous research to support these claims. It is important to discuss cannabis therapy with a qualified healthcare provider before starting treatment.

"Twelve weeks ago, three of us — interns on the Web Platform team — set out to build a compiler from TypeScript to WebAssembly. WebAssembly is a size and load-time-efficient binary format suitable for compilation to the web, with the potential to provide huge performance benefits for web applications. (We found this explanation of WebAssembly useful.)

Before this, none of us had ever written TypeScript or even heard of WebAssembly, and we didn’t know much about compilers either. With that in mind, to say the project goal was ambitious was an understatement.

We started with the basics: building a working mental model of a compiler and abstracting out any details we didn’t really need to know. We read the WebAssembly documentation, tried compiling and running WebAssembly with wasmFiddle, and wrote some simple TypeScript programs.

At first, we developed on a prototype compiler on a fork of the official TypeScript compiler. This is when we hit our first major challenge: once we implemented a few basic features (bitwise operations, binary expressions), we realized that the type system in TypeScript was fundamentally incompatible with the four native numeric types in WebAssembly. We made the decision to assume that number always referred to a float64, because we didn’t want to deviate from TypeScript too much. However, that meant we couldn’t handle wasm operations that could only be done with an int type (remainder, for example) without losing efficiency. We set the issue aside, and instead worked towards emitting the appropriate wasm bytecode for an if statement.

In implementing if statements, we found a new set of challenges that required that we understand more about the structure of the wasm bytecode itself. We started by going through the abstract syntax tree generated by the TypeScript compiler [1], and then mapping that to emit if and else instructions, but we could not figure out how to evaluate a condition and deal with opcode immediates properly. We took a look at the output from wasmFiddle [2] for an if statement and noticed that they were using blocks and break-if opcodes to create the structure. We realized that the two approaches were essentially equivalent, but the blocks were easier for us to keep track of.

[1] Part of the AST typescript generates for an if statement

[2] Bytecode output from wasmFiddle: highlighted section is the main function which contains if, else if, and else statements

We still weren’t able to figure out exactly what to emit, so we tried modifying the wasm bytecode by hand to see if we could get an example if statement to produce the result we expected. This led to a whole slew of additional problems, namely that we needed to also modify the length arguments in the bytecode for each section. We weren’t able to identify that this was the issue right away, but tracking it down meant we were looking at the opcodes individually and learning what section they belonged to, which operations required opcode immediates, and which parts were actually just ASCII encoded characters. Once we had this foundational understanding of wasm, it became much easier to identify the mistakes we were making previously with how to emit opcodes and their immediates.

Soon after making that progress with if statements, we found two open source projects that were attempting to compile a subset or variation of TypeScript to WebAssembly: AssemblyScript and TurboScript. Given what we had learned from our prototype compiler, we liked that AssemblyScript was new and had still had room for us to contribute. It also leveraged the TypeScript compiler, which we had come to be familiar with. Thus, we reached out to AssemblyScript. The main contributor, Daniel Wirtz, was very open to collaborate and accept pull requests from us.

We spent some time experimenting with AssemblyScript, encountering a fair number of build issues and discovering features that we didn’t realize had already been implemented (strings or classes) and features that we expected to work, but didn’t (arrays and floats). We opened several issues along the way, which was new to us as this was the first big open-source project any of us had contributed to. We were soon ready to contribute a feature: compiling array-list initializations in TypeScript to WebAssembly. The AssemblyScript compiler needed to use malloc and memset to set a section of WebAssembly’s linear memory for the array, and then emit the opcodes to set the capacity and the size of the array in memory and then the elements of the array at set intervals of 4 or 8 based on the size of the type.

Once we had started contributing to AssemblyScript and the compiler features, frontend, and testing infrastructure began to mature, we needed to identify what was working well and what could be improved. We then wrote a few demo programs and compiled them to wasm with AssemblyScript, but to our dismay found that the wasm was slower than the JavaScript. Furthermore, we found that writing a compelling demo with a basic compiler was complicated, and that we were missing a lot of features, such as library functions. It was particularly challenging to make fair comparisons between JS and WebAssembly, and to update the UI of the demos as each program did its computation, since both are single-threaded. We used web workers to solve this, which was something we hadn’t done before. We then started doing some detective work to figure out why we were seeing a slowdown in WebAssembly.

The first step we took was to look at the code we were compiling, and break that into parts. We had implemented a sudoku solver that did a lot of computation, but it was also creating and iterating through large arrays and making a lot of function calls. We started compiling small programs that did each of these tasks individually and saw that while computation was much quicker (as we had expected), array access, tail recursion, and function calls were quite slow. For example, the iterative calculation of Fibonacci run 5x faster, yet an array traversal of 4000 elements run 4x slower. We realized we were missing some optimizations that pipelines like Emscripten + binaryen took advantage of. We then created a set of tests based on the Sunspider benchmarks that we could compile with AssemblyScript and Emscripten + binaryen, and wrote them in JavaScript, AssemblyScript-friendly TypeScript, and C. We were very limited on the benchmarks we could write since they needed to be compatible with both compilers, yet we managed to obtain significant results. We then compared the performance to identify in what tasks AssemblyScript was still slow.

Over the course of this project, we learned to test early and constantly, and to never take a feature for granted- the complexity in something even as fundamental as an if statement can be very tricky to debug in WebAssembly. We also learned that making a compiler is a lot easier if you leverage powerful existing tools. We had the privilege of utilizing the incredible work Daniel Wirtz did in building AssemblyScript, as well as the work done by the TypeScript team here at Microsoft, and all the people who worked on binaryen. The overhead to maintain a backend or build a parser would have prevented us from accomplishing as much as we did if we hadn’t embraced the existing open-source tools in the TypeScript and binaryen compiler infrastructure.

"Update 8/6, a clarification. The below article's quotes were taken a bit out of context: http://www.rt.com/news/bolivia-coca-cola-ban-770/

In a symbolic rejection of US capitalism, Bolivia announced it [hopes to] expel the Coca-Cola Company from the country at the end of the Mayan calendar. This will mark the end of capitalism and usher in a new era of equality, the Bolivian govt says.

""December 21 of 2012 will be the end of egoism and division. December 21 should be the end of Coca-Cola,""Bolivian foreign minister David Choquehuanca decreed, with bombast worthy of a viral marketing campaign.

The coming 'end' of the Mayan lunar calendar on December 21 of this year has sparked widespread doomsaying of an impending apocalypse. But Choquehuanca argued differently, claiming it will be the end of days for capitalism, not the planet.


""The planets will align for the first time in 26,000 years and this is the end of capitalism and the beginning of communitarianism,"" said Choquehuanca as quoted by Venezuelan newspaper El Periodiquito.

The minister encouraged the people of Bolivia to drink Mocochinche, a peach-flavored soft drink, as an alternative to Coca-Cola. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez followed suit, encouraging his country to ditch the American beverage for fruit juice produced in Venezuela.

McFailure

Last year, Bolivia became the second Latin American country not to have a single McDonald's. The fast food giant finally gave up on Bolivia after being unable to turn a profit in the country for over a decade.

Following this failure, the monolithic multinational released a documentary titled 'Why McDonald's failed in Bolivia.'Referencing surveys, sociologists, nutritionists and historians, the company came to the conclusion it was not their food that was the issue, but a culturally driven boycott.

Bolivian President Evo Morales has a reputation for controversial policies similar to the Coca-Cola ban. Morales pledged last month to legalize the consumption of coca leaves, one of the main ingredients of cocaine.


""Neither the US nor capitalist countries have a good reason to maintain the ban on coca leaf consumption,"" said Morales.

The coca leaf was declared an illegal narcotic by the UN in 1961, along with cocaine, opium and morphine. The consumption of coca leaves is a centuries-old tradition in Bolivia, strongly rooted in the beliefs of various indigenous groups.",human,human-written
"Here’s a Twitter thread from a newly elected DNC member telling us all how the DNC works — or doesn’t. Every Democratic voter should read this. We need to know the problems of the Democratic party and its subgroups.

It sounds like Atkins means well and wants to do well for the DNC. Even so, the situations he describes illustrate well how institutions such as the DNC are wasting tremendous amounts of liberals’ time, money and energy, while not getting much of the work done that needs to be done to save democracy.

Atkins’ description leads me to a different conclusion than he apparently draws from it. He seems to think there is hope of changing the DNC and other organizations within the Democratic party to become more functional. That doesn’t seem possible to me, because the party seems rigidly stuck in old habits and very attached to and trusting toward consultants who aren’t helping much with winning down ballot elections. New liberal institutions need to be developed because so many of the old ones are not functioning very effectively to stop the spread of fascism.

That’s why I have written an essay asking philanthropists to create new liberal institutions and/or for others to create such institutions and then to seek funding. We need to start over — with organizations that are focused on effectiveness in tasks Democrats must tackle. The party can’t keep wasting endless amounts of money, time, energy and commitment from voters, while being tone deaf to their needs. Instead of the needs of our base, the party has operated based on the ingrained habits of an in-group of politicians and consultants who have been around for decades and who keep the Democratic party firmly in their control . All the while, they keep losing one down ballot election after another.

Open Letter to Liberal Donors: Please Consider Donating to Create Missing Liberal Institutions

There are many outside groups and individuals that do various functions to help the Democratic party. For example a lot of pro-Biden anti-Trump messaging was done this year by the Lincoln Project, VoteVets, MeidasTouch and Don Winslow. I hope to see them continue to help with overall liberal messaging in the future. Democrats need a ton of help there, as the party is not good at messaging.

Moveon and Indivisible have been helping liberals for a long time and have contributed a lot to Democrats and to the nation.

These people and groups don’t ask the Democratic party for its approval. They just form their organization and begin doing the work. That’s good, because the DNC and the Democratic party don’t realize they need help, and would likely say no if asked. That is the best way to do it — just create a group or movement, set liberal goals and achieve them.

I hope to see many more groups doing this. My Open Letter essay above outlines all the kinds of liberal institutions I think we need and why. Atkins’ Twitter thread, at the beginning of this essay, points to a number of problems that need to be resolved — or just avoided from the outset — the new organizations. I hope to see a lot of these new organizations popping up, to help steer the nation away from lies and fascism and toward truth, justice and democracy.",human,human-written
"Recursive function — The trick to get the next page

Ok, here’s the trick to get the job done: Recursiveness.

We are going to create a “parse_page’ function. That function will fetch the 10 albums the page will have.

After the function it is done, it is going to call itself again, with the next page, to parse it, over and over again until we have everything.

Let me simplify it for you:

I hope it is clear: As we keep having a ‘next page’ to parse, we are going to call the same function again and again to fetch all the data. When there is no more, we stop. As simple as that.

Step 1: Create the function

Grab this code, create another function called ‘parse_page(url)’ and call that function at the last line.

The data object is going to be used in different places, take it out and put it after the search_url.

We took the main code and created a parse_page function, called it using the ‘search_url’ as parameter and took the ‘data’ object out so we can use it globally.

In case you are dizzy, here’s what your code should look like now:

Please check this line:

Now we are not fetching the ‘search_url’ (the first one) but the URL that we pass as an argument. This is very important.

Step 2: Add recursion

Run the code again. It should fetch the 10 first albums as always.

That’s why because we haven’t used recursion. Let’s write the code that will:

Get all the pagination links

From all the links, grab the last one

Check if the last one has a ‘Next’ text

If it has it, get the relative (partial) url

Build the next page url by adding base_url and the relative_url

Call parse_page again with the next page url

If doesn’t has the ‘Next’ text, just export the table and print it

Once we have fetched all the cd attributes (that’s it, after the ‘for cd in list_all_cd’ loop), add this line:

We are getting all the ‘list item’ (or ‘li’) elements inside the ‘unordered list’ with the ‘SearchBreadcrumbs’ class. That’s the pagination list.

Then, we go to the last one and get the text. Add this after the last code:

Now we check if ‘next_page_text’ has ‘Next’ as text. If it does, we take the partial url, we add it to the base to build the next_page_url. If it does not, there is no more pages, so we can create the file and print it.

That’s all we need. Run the code, and now you are getting dozens, if not hundreds of items!

Step 3: Fixing a small bug

But we can still improve the code. Add this 4 lines after parsing the page with Beautiful Soup:

Sometimes there is a ‘Next’ page when the numbers of albums are multiple of 10 (10, 20, 30, 40 and so on) but there is no album there. That makes the code to end without creating the file.

With this code, it is fixed.

Your coding is done! Congratulations!",human,human-written
"Okay. We want to do a remake of The Sting, but set it in a modern age.

So the plot could go like this … we are the police — let’s set it in The Netherlands and get great views of canals and boats. Now we aim to target illegal betting, so we set up a sting.

We find the King-Pin, who runs the major illegal betting shop in the major city (let’s say it’s Amsterdam), and then rather than arrest him, we aim to shut down his operation. Before this, we will take-over his main competitor in the city, and then they will tell us everything about their operation and give us their keys to the operation.

We then run their illegal better system (but change all the telephone numbers and all the back-end functions). Next we pounce on King Pin who tells us everything and we shut down his operation. After this, we watch all the bookies and their customers move into our operation, and each time they make a bet, we arrest them.

And just to make sure we catch all of them, we ask them to send us a picture of themselves outside their home.

Far fetched?

Well, replace betting for drug dealing, and a city for the Dark Web, and you have the Dutch Police Sting … read on …

Hansa

The Dark Web has traded fairly free from the prying eyes of law enforcement, mainly because it is difficult to find out where the servers are actually running (as the route to a destination is hidden, along with all the details of the communication). But the Dutch police managed to take-over one of the sites: Hansa. Also part of their plans was a take-down of AlphaBay, and where many users moved to Hansa Market. This saw an eight-fold increase in users.

The start of the take-over happened when, in 2016, a company named Bitdefender told the Dutch Police that Hansa’s servers were operating in the Netherlands. Like AlphaBay, Hansa sold drugs, credit card details, and many other criminal related activities. It also traded with Bitcoins, in order to hide transactions from law enforcement.

The Netherlands National High Tech Crime Unit then took an image of the server and were able to control the administration pages. They also found the chat logs and details of two German nationals who were running the site. These two individuals were well-known to the German police for criminal activities.

The people running the site found out that they were being investigated, so they moved the servers to Lithuania and shut down the Dutch servers. The payment for the servers was then paid through the Bitcoin account that they had been using in the Netherlands, and thus the police were able to trace them. After the police tapped into the communications of the network and found out details of the four administrators and their login details for the chat system.

Then … the sting continues to develop … and where the FBI had found out that Alphabay was hosted in the Netherlands, and where police hatched a plan to close down Alphabay and get dealers and customers to move to Hansa, and then monitor usage (and where the Dutch police would control of the site).

The administrators of Hansa were then arrested on 20 June 2017 and they handed over their login details, and where the police could take over the site and run it. At this point, the servers were now back in the jurisdiction of the Dutch police. They copied the whole site and created a new Bitcoin wallet, and with a downtime of only three minutes. Then, after modifying details for deliveries, they watched the site being used for drug dealing.

Every transaction has then tracked, and EUROPOL sent out offices to intercept the packages and make arrests. Along with this all of the business details and contacts were captured, along with the addition some code which revealed the actual IP address of the buyer and seller. To capture even more, they sent out a message to dealers to resend the image of their “products” as they had had a crash on one of their drives. The images came back often containing the metadata in the image, and where the police could find out their actual location (note the image below is just a demonstration of examining the location information from an image).

So the sting moved into top gear on 4 July 2017, and where Alphabay was shut down and which drove many servers to Hansa. Overall the Dutch police seized over 2,500 Bitcoins and recorded 26,000 transactions, and eventually showed this message:

AlphaBay

AlphaBay had become a bazaar for buying and selling of illegal contraband, including drugs, personal IDs, and weapons, and where vendors can set-up shops and trade:

It had, at its peak, over 200,000 users, 40,000 vendors and generated over $1 billion in transactions. At the time of the take-down, it had nearly $4 million in bitcoins within wallets stored on the site.

As the sites only link to Tor, they cannot be accessed without a Tor browser, and thus cannot be found on Google. Along with, because it uses Tor routing, it is often difficult to find the actual location of the servers.

There were initial signs of a take-down on 4 July 2017 and occurred around the same time that Alexander Cazes (shown below), a Canadian citizen, who created and maintained AlphaBay, was arrested in Thailand and has since been found dead in his prison cell (it is thought that he hanged himself with a towel).

Alexander is now thought to be one of the richest operators on the Dark Web with a wealth of over $15 million, and with a stash of over $5 million in bitcoins, and several million dollars in other . His many top-of-the-range cars have also been seized.

The main reason that Cazes was caught was that he was using his own name in a Hotmail email address that he had used for years (Pimp_Alex_91@hotmail.com). It was this address which was used to welcome every user to the site, and also for password resets. This made it easy for investigators to trace him. Along with the alias for the site (Alpha02) was linked to his email address. When investigators seized his laptop they found it wasn’t encrypted, and where they could gain passwords to the Alphabet servers. It is estimated that AlphaBay was bringing in between $600,000 and $800,000 in revenue every day.

Conclusion

On the Dark Web, which legal jurisdiction actually applies? Only by finding the physical location of the servers will it be possible to apply the laws of that jurisdiction. Also, will law enforcement go after those who sold or purchased goods on the sites, and will they actually be able to trace them (as their IDs will be hidden within Bitcoin IDs)?

In a previous post, I discussed how cycle time plays a key role in optimising the delivery health of engineering teams at SafetyCulture. In this post, I will dive a little deeper into how we measure specific delivery metrics in minutes using JIRA and the ActionableAgile JIRA plugin.

Three metrics we have been tracking this way are:

Cycle time

Deployment frequency (customer-facing changes per week)

Deployment frequency (non-customer facing changes per week)

Although the process described above is rather manual, once the initial setup is done it usually takes no more than a couple of minutes to get the metrics needed. Combined with JIRA’s and ActionableAgile’s flexibility around filtering, trend visualisation, and deep-dive insights, we have found this approach preferable compared to more automated but less flexible methods we have tried or the option of building and maintaining such tooling ourselves.

it usually takes no more than a couple of minutes to get the metrics needed

The process consists of a one-time setup step, followed by a simple metric visualisation step.

Part 1 — Setup

Installing ActionableAgile

We have purchased and installed the ActionableAgile JIRA plugin on our JIRA cloud subscription from here. Once installed, it automatically updates to the latest version.

Setting up a cross-team JIRA board

Our teams each use a different JIRA project and board. To be able to see metrics across different teams we have created a JIRA board with a special JQL filter that combines all relevant team projects. The filter looks like this:

project in (TEAMA, TEAMB, TEAMC) AND labels not in (outlier) AND updated >= -24w AND status was not in (“Won’t Do”) ORDER BY updated DESC, Rank ASC

Setting up the team’s project

We want to exclude tickets closed as “Won’t Do”. “Next gen” JIRA projects do not support a “Won’t Do” resolution so we use JIRA Classic projects.

To be able to quickly see metrics from different teams on the same ActionableAgile dashboard we label every ticket with the team name. We do that so that we can then filter by this label later on. We give these labels consistent names like inspections-team, actions-team etc. so that it is visually easier to select them later on.

We automate adding the team label to all new tickets created by going to Project Automation in our JIRA project and adding a rule as shown in the image below:

For projects with an existing backlog, we also run a bulk issue update once to apply the team label to all existing tickets.

Excluding particular types of work

Sometimes we need to exclude certain types of work from the metrics calculation. For instance, tickets that capture a long-running background monitoring process or other non-delivery-related tickets for which the metrics described here are not suitable. We do that by manually labeling such tickets in JIRA with a label of our choice (we use “outlier”). This allows us to filter them out from the board later (as shown in the JIRA filter earlier).

Dealing with “blocked time”

When work in progress gets blocked for a non-trivial amount of time (say half a day) we add a flag and a comment to the JIRA ticket to indicate. Similarly, we remove the flag when the work can be resumed. This not only raises visibility of blockages on the JIRA board, it also allows us to control whether to include or exclude blockage time from the collected metrics. There are useful insights in either case. Note that even though we do not work on weekends we do not treat weekends as “blocked time” so that cycle time reported more closely resembles the customer experience.

Classifying work

By convention, we raise Story and Bug tickets for changes with direct customer-facing impact such as a UI change. Otherwise, we use Task. This helps collect metrics for customer-facing changes only as required.

Part 2— Tutorial

In the following section, I will walk you through how we answer some key delivery questions at SafetyCulture.

To get started:

On your JIRA project page, on the left-hand side menu panel click “ActionableAgile” to open the plugin. The ActionableAgile main page loads.

On the top right-hand corner, click the folder icon and “Load a board”.

Select the board you created earlier to combine all projects of interest. If there are too many tickets you can opt to only load tickets after a particular date to save on loading time.

Continue.

Select all ticket fields when prompted. You can trim fields if you would like to optimise the time it takes to load the dashboard in the future.

Continue.

On the right-hand side open the filter settings and:

select the ticket types you want to track. We track Bug, Story, and Task tickets

select your team’s label from the list of labels

select the “Done” item from the “Resolution” column to exclude “Won’t do”

Close the filter settings window to go back to the ActionableAgile main page.

On the right-hand menu panel:

untick “todo” and/or “backlog” stage from the “Workflow stages” (unless you explicitly want to measure lead time instead of cycle time)

choose whether to “include blocked time”

tick “Average (Beta)” to track average cycle time

NB. ActionableAgile does not refresh automatically each time the page is reloaded. To get the latest project data: Go to the “folder icon” at the top right and “Check for updates to <your board’s name>”

Refreshing to get latest data

Now we are ready to collect our metrics.

What was the average cycle time last week?

From the bottom panel, drag to select the time period e.g. the last 7 days as required. The average cycle time will be shown as a dotted line on the scatterplot above. If not enough tickets were completed in the selected period, extend the time period to include earlier tickets until a reliable average can be computed.

Cycle time for a selected date range

How many customer-facing and non-customer-facing releases were made in the last 7 days?

Here we assume that each ticket that is not labeled as an “outlier” (as described above) results in one deployment/release.

To find the number of customer-facing releases, on the right-hand side open the filter settings and:

select the customer-facing ticket types: Bug and Story only

Customer-facing changes only filter

open “Summary Statistics”

see how many customer-facing releases were made in the chosen date range

To see all releases, including non-customer-facing ones, repeat the same process above after you have also ticked the “Task” ticket type at the first step above.

If you want to review the releases individually in more detail, you can hover over the dots on the cycle time scatterplot and deep dive into each JIRA ticket.

"I’m a part of a few clergy groups on social networking sites. They exist as a much needed resource and a place for clergy to speak plainly with each other. Some folks offer humor. Some tell stories of awesome things that happen in their congregations and how they saw God at work — those are pretty great! And for some, these are places they can receive pastoral care and a listening ear from other clergy — also very needed.

Since the pandemic started, it is has been difficult to read some of the posts, but I read them anyway.

We’re about to hit a triple crisis in the church. The first crisis is churches closing because they can’t or won’t adapt or don’t have the resources to make it through the pandemic.

The second crisis is one that has been building for some time before the pandemic hit — a slew of clergy retirements. This will leave many churches wondering what to do, and many churches finding themselves without a dedicated pastor.

The third crisis is clergy burnout. The pandemic is hitting clergy pretty hard. None of us were trained for this. And the pandemic, combined with such a polarized society, is causing long term trauma. And in many cases, clergy are feeling the effects. And many are just burnt out, or done with dealing with it all.

I feel for these colleagues. And I don’t have any ill thoughts about clergy that call it a day. Each clergy person has to discern what God is calling them to or from. It’s not easy.

In some cases, the stories I have read can leave a person with their jaw dropped. Except they aren’t all that uncommon unfortunately. Especially if you read many stories on these sites over a long period of time.

For many of the clergy that are burning out, the pandemic is just more gasoline on a raging fire. They were in calls that were in toxic cultures to begin with. I’m not talking about difficult calls or even unhealthy one. Toxic calls.

These include meetings about clergy where the clergy person is not invited and decisions are made about them and they are informed about them after the fact. These include people who should be described as abusive because that’s the best description there is. These include so many other variations of the same thing — often multiple layers of such things.

Often the stories include abusive congregants with unrealistic expectations and doing some pretty unacceptable behaviors towards the clergy person. Battles over compensation. Manipulation. Passive Aggressive cultures. Etc.

Now, before I go any further, let me say this — I feel blessed because regardless of how difficult a day I may have, the congregation I serve is a blessing. It’s not perfect of course, but I don’t know of a congregation that is frankly. And I’m far from a perfect pastor. But all in all, we in ministry together and that is a beautiful thing.

But the question remains, what does the church look like by 2025? Or even 2022, after this pandemic has probably subsided (although who knows anymore).

I’m willing to bet that it doesn’t look like it does today. The reality is that there will be churches that close and pastors that either retire or leave their calls. And then what?

I think this is also an immense gift and opportunity for the church to rethink what a congregation is and how it operates. Here’s what I think — the idea of hybrid church will expand. I’m saying beyond the idea of digital/in-person. What if hybrid meant taking a group of churches and linking them together — to share resources, staff, facility, technology, etc. What if the idea of congregation changes as well. Can you imaging having something like an anchor church that is linked to a few other “congregations?” Maybe three congregations are ones with buildings. Maybe one of those buildings gets converted for other ministry use between the congregations? What if one of the congregations is solely online? What if one of those congregations is a house church? What is some kind of social ministry became attached to this as well? They would expand the idea of community, that’s for sure.

I think it is helpful for the church to tap into something it hasn’t done very well in recent times — imagination. That hasn’t always been the case though. Jesus had imagination — he talked about the Kingdom of God all the time. It’s an abstract idea that Jesus took and put words and ideas to, along with action, and he put some skin on it and made it tangible. And the church grew and expanded, thanks to imagination and faith.

Faith is imaginative. It has to be. Faith is declaring what the future will look like and bringing the present into that future. That takes imagination.

A crisis is coming church. We have some choices to make in response. Do we huddle in and brace ourselves for the worst? Or do we go all in on faith, risking it all? Or do we choose something else? Let’s use our imagination that God gave us and answer the call that God has for us. We have been given a gift in this moment. Let’s embrace it.",human,human-written
"So why did Bode Express steal the show at this year’s Preakness Stakes? Is it because unfortunately Johnny Velazquez was thrown off and it was amusing to watch the 2 year old run by himself? I don’t think it was just that!

While it is great and vindicating that War of Will won the Preakness, can we talk about the Will of Bode Express?

Bode demonstrates, in my opinion, the ‘working class hero’ as John Lennon sings. Bode rolled up his hoofs, said I GOT THIS and literally competed down the stretch of the Preakness !

He embodied what every human strives to be: the self-sufficient, having it all together, when life gives you lemons, you make lemonade type of mentality . Did it make you think, how can a a 2 yr. old horse keep his cool the whole way? I hope so because that cool way is something we can all pick up on.

As humans we fall apart at the slightest inconvenience or slightest thing going wrong. Maybe Bode today is beloved because he did not crumble! We too, don’t have to crumble, just do what Bode did and run on in this God-given journey known as life!

Ford isn't exactly known for semitrucks around the world, but that may soon change. At the IAA Commercial Vehicle Show in Germany on Thursday, Ford showed off its F-Vision Future Truck concept. 
Ford Otosan, based in Turkey and the automaker's largest commercial vehicle production base, debuted the F-Vision as an electric tractor with Level 4 self-driving capability. It's the company's first concept truck and it focuses on a future where semitrucks feature lightweight construction and zero emissions.
The concept truck debuted alongside the F-Max tractor at the IAA show, which was awarded 2019 International Truck of the Year.
Ford didn't detail the powertrain behind the F-Vision concept truck, however. Nor did it provide estimated power or range ratings.

Instead, Ford focused on the semi's design. The F-Vision was inspired by Marvel characters, the automaker said, and the way they change and adapt to environments. The motif is most present in the glass line, which descends and increases the field of view for an operator inside the cab.
When the F-Vision is operating in self-driving mode, the glass line blends back into the bodywork to echo the streamlined shape of the truck. The shape itself is very familiar compared to future semi concepts we've seen from Tesla and others, though the large LED lights certainly mimic the F-Series sold in the United States.
The semi's adaptable nature also comes with the F-Vision front face. Ford said an ""interactive front end"" can display different designs and communication methods, but didn't go into further detail. The staple Ford oval is also missing in action in favor of a back-lit badge spelling out ""Ford.""
The F-Vision is simply that: a vision. However, it could foreshadow experimental elements coming to future Ford trucks in other parts of the globe.

There is no method for instantly creating funnel charts in Matplotlib, so let’s start with a simple horizontal bar chart and build from there.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt y = [5,4,3,2,1]

x = [80,73,58,42,23] plt.barh(y, x)

Horizontal Bar Chart — Image by the author

That’s actually quite close to what we want, so why not stop here and use a bar chart instead?

It may be even easier to compare the values with a simple bar chart, but choosing the funnel-shaped one can make the relationship between the bars more explicit and make our visualization more appealing.

Ok, so we’ll need to plot one bar at a time and use the ‘left’ parameter to adjust its position in the chart. Let’s check how this works.

y = [5,4,3,2,1]

x = [80,73,58,42,23] x_max = 100

x_min = 0 for idx, val in enumerate(x):

plt.barh(y[idx], x[idx], left = idx+5) plt.xlim(x_min, x_max)

Horizontal bar chart with floating bars — Image by the author

We have the bars' size, which is x and the range of the x-axis, which is 100.

The difference between those values is the blank space, and to center the bars, we need to have the same amount of blank space on each side.

So we can say that:

left = (size of the bar - x-axis range) / 2

Let’s see how this looks.

y = [5,4,3,2,1]

x = [80,73,58,42,23] x_max = 100

x_min = 0 for idx, val in enumerate(x):

left = (x_max - val)/2

plt.barh(y[idx], x[idx], left = left, color='grey') plt.xlim(x_min, x_max)

Funnel chart — Image by the author

Great! But the axis information doesn’t mean much now that the bars don’t have the same starting point.

We need to print the values on the bars and connect them.

y = [5,4,3,2,1]

x = [80,73,58,42,23] x_max = 100

x_min = 0 fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(12,6)) for idx, val in enumerate(x):

left = (x_max - val)/2

plt.barh(y[idx], x[idx], left = left, color='grey', height=1, edgecolor='black')

# value

plt.text(50, y[idx], x[idx], ha='center', fontproperties=font,

fontsize=16, color='#2A2A2A') plt.axis('off')

plt.xlim(x_min, x_max)

Funnel chart with values — Image by the author

Alright, we could add a title, some labels for the bars, and call it a day.

But let’s give our viewers some eye-candy and add a shadow connecting the bars instead of just stacking them. That will make our chart and the connection between the bars more clear.

First, let’s define all the variables we’ll need

from matplotlib import font_manager as fm # funnel chart

y = [5,4,3,2,1]

x = [80,73,58,42,23]

labels = ['Hot Leads', 'Samples Sent', 'Quotes', 'Negotiations', 'Sales'] x_max = 100

x_min = 0

x_range = x_max - x_min fpath = ""fonts/NotoSans-Regular.ttf""

font = fm.FontProperties(fname=fpath)

Now, let’s add some more details to our plot.

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(12,6)) for idx, val in enumerate(x):

left = (x_range - val)/2

plt.barh(y[idx], x[idx], left = left, color='#808B96',

height=.8, edgecolor='black')

# label

plt.text(50, y[idx]+0.1, labels[idx], ha='center',

fontproperties=font, fontsize=16, color='#2A2A2A')

# value

plt.text(50, y[idx]-0.3, x[idx], ha='center',

fontproperties=font, fontsize=16, color='#2A2A2A')



plt.xlim(x_min, x_max)

plt.axis('off') plt.title('Beskar Forging Services Inc.', fontproperties=font, loc='center', fontsize=24, color='#2A2A2A') plt.show()

Funnel chart with title and labels — Image by the author

*Font from https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans

We’ll plot a line from one side to the other of the bars. We can use the value of left to find the start and end of the bar and the y-value to find its center.

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(12,6)) for idx, val in enumerate(x):

left = (x_range - val)/2

plt.barh(y[idx], x[idx], left = left, color='#808B96', height=.8, edgecolor='black')

# label

plt.text(50, y[idx]+0.1, labels[idx], ha='center',

fontproperties=font, fontsize=16, color='#2A2A2A')

# value

plt.text(50, y[idx]-0.3, x[idx], ha='center',

fontproperties=font, fontsize=16, color='#2A2A2A')



plt.plot([left, 100-left], [y[idx], y[idx]]) plt.xlim(x_min, x_max)

plt.axis('off') plt.title('Beskar Forging Services Inc.', fontproperties=font, loc='center', fontsize=24, color='#2A2A2A') plt.show()

Funnel chart with some lines on it — Image by the author

Now let’s move this line to the bottom of the bar, and since we won’t have a connection after the last bar, we can skip drawing a shadow for it.

We defined the bars' height as 0.8, so to move the lines to the bottom, we could decrease y to 0.4.

We’ll also need the coordinates of the top of the next bar.

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(12,6)) for idx, val in enumerate(x):

left = (x_range - val)/2

plt.barh(y[idx], x[idx], left = left, color='#808B96', height=.8, edgecolor='black')

# label

plt.text(50, y[idx]+0.1, labels[idx], ha='center',

fontproperties=font, fontsize=16, color='#2A2A2A')

# value

plt.text(50, y[idx]-0.3, x[idx], ha='center',

fontproperties=font, fontsize=16, color='#2A2A2A')



if idx != len(x)-1:

next_left = (x_range - x[idx+1])/2 plt.plot([left, 100-left],

[y[idx]-0.4, y[idx]-0.4]) plt.plot([next_left, 100-next_left],

[y[idx+1]+0.4, y[idx+1]+0.4]) plt.xlim(x_min, x_max)

plt.axis('off') plt.title('Beskar Forging Services Inc.', fontproperties=font, loc='center', fontsize=24, color='#2A2A2A') plt.show()

Funnel chart with even more lines on it — Image by the author

We found all the points we need to draw. Now we can connect those points and see if we get the shape we’re looking for.

Don’t forget to repeat the first point at the end to close the polygon.

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(12,6)) for idx, val in enumerate(x):

left = (x_range - val)/2

plt.barh(y[idx], x[idx], left = left, color='#808B96', height=.8, edgecolor='black')

# label

plt.text(50, y[idx]+0.1, labels[idx], ha='center',

fontproperties=font, fontsize=16, color='#2A2A2A')

# value

plt.text(50, y[idx]-0.3, x[idx], ha='center',

fontproperties=font, fontsize=16, color='#2A2A2A')



if idx != len(x)-1:

next_left = (x_range - x[idx+1])/2 shadow_x = [left, next_left,

100-next_left, 100-left, left]



shadow_y = [y[idx]-0.4, y[idx+1]+0.4,

y[idx+1]+0.4, y[idx]-0.4, y[idx]-0.4] plt.plot(shadow_x, shadow_y) plt.xlim(x_min, x_max)

plt.axis('off') plt.title('Beskar Forging Services Inc.', fontproperties=font, loc='center', fontsize=24, color='#2A2A2A') plt.show()

Funnel chart with the bars connected — Image by the author

Perfect. All that’s left to do is change the .plot to .fill and we have our funnel chart ready.

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(12,6)) for idx, val in enumerate(x):

left = (x_range - val)/2

plt.barh(y[idx], x[idx], left = left,

shadow_y = [y[idx]-0.4, y[idx+1]+0.4,

y[idx+1]+0.4, y[idx]-0.4, y[idx]-0.4] plt.fill(shadow_x, shadow_y, color='grey', alpha=0.6) plt.xlim(x_min, x_max)

"WeakRefs

WeakRef stands for Weak References. The main use of weak references is to implement caches.

Since JavaScript is a garbage collected language, if a variable is no longer reachable, the GC automatically removes it. As a good practice, we would not want to keep a lot in memory for a long time. We can allow the memory to be garbage collected and later if we need it again, we can generate a fresh cache.

Example:

// callback function

const callback = () => {

const obj = {

name: ""Harsha""

};

console.log(obj);

} // IIFE function to print the object after 3 secs

(async function(){

await new Promise((resolve) => {

setTimeout(() => {

callback(); // {name: ""Harsha""}

resolve();

}, 3000);

});

})();

The above example might seem complicated. But, it is actually simple. The code basically calls a callback function after 3 seconds, where the function prints an object. Whenever we call the callback function, the obj is still present in the memory. To manage cache efficiently we can use WeakRef .

// callback function

const callback = () => {

const obj = new WeakRef({

name: ""Harsha""

});

console.log(obj.deref().name);

} // IIFE function to print the object after 2 and 5 secs

(async function(){

await new Promise((resolve) => {

setTimeout(() => {

callback(); // Guaranteed to print ""Harsha""

resolve();

}, 2000);

});



await new Promise((resolve) => {

setTimeout(() => {

callback(); // No Gaurantee that ""Harsha"" is printed

resolve();

}, 5000);

});

"The current state of precautions as the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps the globe, is seeing a mass cancelling of events, gigs and other physical interactions due to safety measures. While we need to ensure everyone stays safe and prevents the spread of the virus any further, the repercussions on our creative community have been huge.

Live performances, gigs, meetups, festivals, workshops, local businesses, creative freelancers and other gig workers have been affected by these cancellations, which calls for a solution and a group effort to band together and #SupportLocalProjects

We want to highlight some clear ways in which you can access support for your own creative output, an artist or organisation that is doing it tough, or simply show your appreciation to this community during this time. Share the message with all those who need to hear it: we all can lean on each other and bring our elbows together in solidarity!

‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎

Support Local Artists via Streaming, Buying Merch or Sharing their Music/Art with your friends!

Check out your favourite local artists’ website to see if you can support them by buying a record or a t-shirt. Bandcamp is a great platform for artists to sell their music and merch online, and for fans to support them without buying a ticket to a show. They recently gave 100% of all proceeds back to artists for 24hrs but even with their regular fee, the artist will receive up to 85% of the purchase.

‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎

Run a Crowdfunding Campaign via Pozible!

We are always here to help creatives in setting up and getting the most out of a campaign to raise funds for a specific project or idea. Now is the time for artists to get creative and use their networks to raise funds. Is it just me, or is anyone else keen to hear what amazing albums/EPs/livestreams can come from #socialdistancing and not playing live gigs?!

‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎

Check out this newly-created website where you can register your gig or event that was cancelled and add it to the list of over 250k (and counting) live events that cannot go ahead. Plenty of resources for music industry and hospitality workers too!

‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎

This topic is one that will no doubt develop and become more normal as this situation unfolds. Currently, we are unsure as to how long the ban on live events will go on for so for artists looking to stream performances or offer fans a way of engaging with them, this is the next best thing.

"On the back end of yesterday’s blog we had an exceptional Question of the Day asked about another of the psychological shortcuts, psychological tips and cognitive bias tools that we can utilise in our copywriting

It comes from @johannesegberts, who asks about Pattern Interrupts inside of the copywriting specific psychological framework

If you aren’t familiar with pattern interrupts, they’re essentially a psychological aspect inside of our “attention demanding” framework. Think of something that draws your attention away from where it currently is — that is essentially a pattern interrupt. Your prior pattern of attention and thought was interrupted…

Think about how we are in specific moods at times and then something will come along - bet it a thought or person, or we hear something - and BANG…

… we experience a complete and total state change because our attention has shifted from what we were focused on to what we are now focusing on

When do we want to interrupt patterns with our copy? At almost any and all times!

Attention grabbing headlines

Attention grabbing our images

Pieces of copy that create tension and disconfirm the readers original thoughts and beliefs. Things that shape up their worldview

The pattern interrupt is one of the powerful psychological frameworks that we can utilise in our copy, specifically one known as the disrupt and reframe.

The simplest example of this is when we think about babies…

They do not want to eat their food… they’re crying… their attention is drawn elsewhere… so what do we do? We play a game and say “…here comes the airplane”

They focus on this imaginary airplane and after a couple of minutes they’ve completely eaten all the food. The airplane support them to forget they didn’t want to eat and they took the action we desired

Their thought pattern had been disrupted and reframed in another way… about the fact that they don’t want to eat, and the food is gone

In your copy, think about how to can say something that creates some tension to generate emotion that ties into your audience’s worldview, perspective, or story that they’re telling themselves

Something that makes them stop, think, potentially disagree and deepen the level of attention of theirs that you have. With this deepened attention we can then tell them a story and then at the end we can reframe — by giving a piece of advice, information or education that’s going to reframe their perspective and move them closer to being in alignment with our desired call to action

The disruption needs to be something that your readers, listeners and audience have an association with. This is the key. To discover this you need to look at the stories they’re familiar with. Is there an association that there’s an attachment to that’s going to disrupt my current readers attention? If so, how can I use to to grab their attention and make them come over to listen to what I have to say…

The Disrupt & Reframe. It’s powerful. Use it

Journaling Prompt: what stories are my readers attached to fictionally, or do they tell themselves inside their own heads that I can use to disrupt their current attention and tell my story instead?

"The Ketchikan School Board discussed Wednesday about transgender policies for student athletes, and how such policies need to be uniform for state competitions.

Superintendent Robert Boyle gave an overview of the Alaska School Activities Association’s policy on transgender athletes:

“Whatever each school district has as their individual policies is allowable,” he said. “If a school district has no policy, then the policy is their birth certificate governs the sport that they should play in.”

Ketchikan’s policy on transgender students is inclusive, Boyle said, but other school districts are more restrictive. Because of that, he says, the ASAA policy is problematic.

“There are already multiple district policies, district approaches to this issue,” he said. “And that means that it very clearly will have districts in conflict with each other.”

Boyle asked the School Board for direction. He suggested that the district encourage ASAA to adjust its policy.

The board agreed with Boyle’s assessment of the problem.

“I think it’s a really weak move on behalf of ASAA,” board member Misty Archibald said. “I think it’s a sticky situation that they don’t really want to take a position on. Their job is to regulate activity so that there’s consistency statewide. It’s not going to work the way they’re doling this out. It’s not going to work across all the different communities in our state.”

The board directed Boyle to contact the Association of Alaska School Boards to discuss the issue.

Also Wednesday, the School Board voted to accept the resignation of Board President Michelle O’Brien, approved board goals for the coming school year and approved the purchase of $80,000 worth of Chromebook laptops for Schoenbar Middle School students.

The next Ketchikan School Board meeting is Aug. 24, which also is the first day of school for the fiscal year 2017 school year.",human,human-written
"How to watch Netflix on DStv?

With the new DStv Explora Ultra, subscribers get streaming apps Showmax and Netflix already installed.

The new DStv Explora Ultra allows users to watch Netflix on their TV, making it easier for existing Netflix subscriber or not. It’s the first set-top box in South Africa to allow DStv subscribers to log into Netflix, as well as other streaming apps, including Showmax, Prime Video, and also to allow new Netflix subscribers to sign up, sign into and cancel their Netflix subscription through the decoder.

What to Watch

How to Access Netflix on DStv?

Netflix is a streaming app that you’ll find in the Apps menu on the new DStv Explora Ultra. It’s not a channel on the DStv package as Netflix is one company, with its own catalogue of shows and movies, and DStv is another, separate company.

The partnership between DStv and Netflix has allowed the Netflix app a space on the decoder. This allows DStv subscribers get seamless access to all the shows and movies on Netflix directly from their decoder.

How do I sign into my Netflix account on my Explora Ultra decoder?

If you are an existing Netflix subscriber with an Explora Ultra, the process is quite easy.

All you need to do is hit the APPS button on your Explora Ultra remote, and then sign into Netflix. The same goes for Showmax, which is also accessible through the APPS button on the remote.

How do I sign up for Netflix on my Explora Ultra decoder?

Using the white APPS button on the remote, you go to Netflix and select “sign up”. Once you’ve done this, your Netflix bill will automatically be added to your DStv bill, so you don’t have to make two separate payments.

The existing payment method you use to pay for DStv will be used for paying for Netflix.

How do I add my Netflix bill to my DStv bill?

If you are already a Netflix subscriber, and sign into Netflix on the DStv Explora Ultra, you won’t be able to add Netflix to your DStv account. You will continue being billed for Netflix as you did before you signed into Netflix on your decoder.

The only way to have Netflix added to your DStv bill is to sign up for Netflix as a new user through the Explora Ultra. New users who sign up to Netflix through the DStv Explora Ultra (hit the APPS button on your remote and follow the sign-up instructions) will automatically have their Netflix bill added to their DStv bill.

But if you have a Netflix account that has lapsed and is not currently active, you can reactivate it on the Explora Ultra by selecting “Join now” on the APPS menu (again, hit that handy APPS button on the remote). Enter your existing log-in details and your account will be reactivated, with the bill automatically added to your Explora Ultra remote.

If I sign up to Netflix on the Explora Ultra, can I only watch Netflix on my TV?

No, when you sign up to Netflix on the Explora Ultra, you get the same access to Netflix that you’d get if you signed up on the Netflix website. You will also be able to stream Netflix on a smartphone, tablet or your web browser. The Explora Ultra is just a device on which to stream Netflix like any other device

How much does it cost to watch Netflix on DStv?

It costs the same as what you’d pay for a Netflix subscription if you signed up through the Netflix website. The price of Netflix will be added to your monthly DStv bill. There’s no extra fee for Netflix when you sign up on your Explora.

Do I need the internet to watch Netflix on DStv?

Yes. Netflix is a streaming video service, which means that to watch, you’ll need access to the internet. The Explora Ultra offers built-in WiFi, which means it’s very easy to connect to the internet in your home.

You will ideally want an uncapped connection because of the volume of data consumed when streaming. The recommended speeds of the connection for streaming video are as follows:

A minimum 2Mbps is recommended for SD (Standard Definition) downloads

For SD streaming, a minimum of 4Mbps

For HD (High Definition) streaming, a minimum of 10Mbps (plus connection to an HD capable TV)

For 4K streaming, which Netflix offers, we recommend checking the Netflix website for guidelines (Need a 4K-capable TV)

Also you will also be able to stream shows and movies on streaming service Showmax as well as Catch Up shows on DStv with your Explora Ultra decoder.

Happy viewing everyone",human,human-written
"On Tuesday morning, the Cleveland Browns cleaned house. Again. General manager Michael Lombardi -- gone. CEO Joe Banner -- on his way out. It seemed stunning, even by Browns standards.

Who gives the brass the boot in early February after a coaching search? And why does this seem like an annual tradition?

If you listened closely, wherever you were in this great country, you heard the media and fans cackling in unison. It was like Jimmy Haslam's press conference was a sitcom filmed in front of a live studio audience, or a Chris Rock comedy special.

The Browns were mocked as clowns, a mess of an organization. Cleveland changing coaches and executives like you change your socks. Everyone was having a grand old time yukking it up.

Laugh now, but the joke will be on you later.

Haslam saw a problem. He fixed it. The Browns are much better off. Seriously.

Haslam is an easy target: He buys the team, makes sweeping changes, oddly structures the front office, unsuccessfully targets big-name coaches before settling on Rob Chudzinski, fires Chud less than 365 days later, struggles to find a coach who wants the gig, hires Mike Pettine to coach the team despite Banner's dreams of Dan Quinn, then gets rid of Banner and Lombardi.

Whew. I need a rest after re-reading that.

Such rapid and unrelenting change can signal the lack of a plan or vision -- and maybe that's the case here. Or maybe Jimmy Haslam just hit a home run.

The Lombardi and Banner dynamic wasn't working. TheMMQB.com's Peter King and The Plain Dealer's Mary Kay Cabot have provided some excellent reporting on Cleveland's issues over the past few days, including King's detailing of Greg Schiano's interview with the Browns, which revealed dysfunction and disconnect at the top.

One coaching agent told me on Tuesday, ""Jimmy (Haslam) had one idea. Mike had another. Joe another one. That leads to confusion and chaos. That's what happened with the coaching search in both of the last two years. That's the turn-off."" Or as one rival executive explained to me, ""Mike is a great football guy, but he couldn't get many things he wanted past Joe. It just didn't work. Now, with Ray (Farmer), they are back in business.""

Oh, yes, they are.

Farmer is a highly respected personnel man in the NFL. Well before this promotion, it was clear that he was on the fast track to becoming a general manager somewhere. He's detail-oriented and intelligent, and he will get things done. Haslam said Farmer will have full control of the 53-man roster. That's a big deal. Lombardi, the prior GM, did not enjoy this luxury. Farmer recently had the chance to become the Miami Dolphins' general manager, but he passed to stay in Cleveland. While folks laugh at the Browns, that says something.

Cleveland won four games in 2013. But with the regime changes, a whole bunch of cap space and a ton of talent already on the roster, I think the Browns are in prime position to double their win total in 2014. Again, seriously.

Pettine might not have been the team's first choice, but he's an excellent one. He was a superb assistant at his first two NFL stops (Baltimore Ravens and New York Jets), and he immediately turned around the Buffalo Bills' defense as their coordinator last year. Pettine brings a much-needed blend of savvy, swagger and sensibility to Cleveland's head-coaching position.

I talked to Pettine two weeks ago on my SiriusXM Radio show, ""Schein on Sports,"" and he raved about the Browns' talent on defense. ""We are going to have an attacking-style defense that Cleveland fans will be proud of,"" he said. Given Pettine's history, the Browns' strong pass rushers and Joe Haden's emergence as one of the NFL's best corners, it seems Cleveland's defense is indeed going to rock.

I also loved the choice of Kyle Shanahan for the offensive coordinator position. Executives rave about the young coach's shrewdness in the X's-and-O's sense. And with the impending passing of the Brandon Weeden era, Shanahan will have the opportunity to help define a fresh approach at the quarterback position. Talking to Pettine, it's clear there is no question the Browns will bring in a new QB or two. How great would Kirk Cousins look in a Cleveland uniform, reuniting with Shanahan? Even better, how great would Johnny Manziel look running Shanahan's offense? Say what you want about Mr. Football, but he, along with Pettine and Shanahan, would give the Browns the right attitude and mentality going into Baltimore, Pittsburgh and Cincinnati.

The Browns have two first-round picks and 10 overall in an incredibly deep draft. They have options.

Debate: Most enticing free agent WR? Many notable receivers -- like Jeremy Maclin -- are hitting the open market. Who's the best option? Our analysts debate.

Many notable receivers -- like-- are hitting the open market. Who's the best option? Our analysts debate. READ

And with all that cap room, they can make a splash in free agency, too. How about signing Ben Tate to play running back? That'd fill a gaping hole. And check the list of receivers hitting the open market -- some enticing options there. Do you think Eric Decker or Hakeem Nicks would look good alongside Josh Gordon and Jordan Cameron?

Laughing is healthy. I encourage it. But stop chuckling at Cleveland. Get past the bevy of changes. Look at the result of the perceived insanity.

It's easy to compare this to George Steinbrenner's New York Yankees of the 1980s. But maybe the better comparison is to what happened in the winter of 1995, when ""The Boss"" hired Bob Watson and some guy named Joe Torre. Remember when the back page of the New York Daily News screamed ""Clueless Joe""?

The Browns are actually moving in the right direction. Get past the laughter and think about it.

"Founded in 2014 by futurist and philosopher Zoltan Istvan, the Transhumanist Party is an American non-profit political organization, which advocates the use of non-discriminatory implementations of science and technology to solve a majority of the world’s problems. Despite being in its early stages, the Transhumanist party has been incredibly inspirational for millions of people who are seeking modern, progressive solutions to the challenges we face as a species.

The current leader of the Transhumanist Party, Zoltan Istvan, is running for US president in 2016. At the heart of Zoltan’s platform is a focus on the use of science and technology in the pursuit of immortality. He also promotes free education for all, an end to US military actions abroad, and the implementation of a Universal Basic Income (UBI).

Zoltan’s campaign platform can found here.

Zoltan was kind enough to answer a few questions for Basic Income News, specifically regarding his support for a UBI.

Dawn Howard: You have made UBI part of your 2016 presidential election platform. Can you tell us who you are thinking about appointing as your chief economics advisor? Does he or she have experience designing or implementing UBI pilots?

Zoltan Istvan: A UBI Plan is a huge part of my campaign. As someone who contemplates technology all day long, I am sure that robots are going to take many if not nearly all jobs in the next 10 to 35 years. So we need a way to transition society to being able to happily live in an age where there are no jobs. UBI is the perfect vehicle.

While I have advisors helping me sort out the basics of implementing a basic income, I can’t reveal who might fill the role of implementing that program. But we would draw on experts that have already had some experience in their own nations of doing so.

DH: Several countries including Canada, India and most recently Finland have already tested or are in the process of testing basic income for a small portion of their population. How do you feel about this type of research, and do you think it could work in the US?

ZI: One of the best things to happen to the world in the last few years is having smaller populated nations test out a UBI. It gives the larger nations the evidence they need to confidently implement their own plans one day, and it offers a road map to follow.

DH: Many in the UBI community speak of a “transition” in terms of the timeline between passing legislation and full implementation. In as little or as much detail as you wish, can you tell us what you think this transition would look like?

ZI: I think the transition would probably take five to six years to fulfill from the point legislation passed to everyone having a basic income. While I support a quick transition, we also must be careful not to disturb our national economy too much as this historic process takes place. It would be better to do it slowly, but correctly, rather than force it and lead to a recession, or worse. Capitalism is changing due to technology, and may not even survive 30 years into the future. We must be able to change with it and help the needs of every single citizen out there. But we must also not be hasty.

I remember the moment I figured it might be time to quit watching porn. Half of my Facebook friends were sharing this story, which links out to a bunch of tests that tell you whether the amount of jerking off at a screen you're doing is healthy. The lead image is an empty black leather couch in the middle of a room, facing a dark shiny desk. Sound familiar? If not, good for you. It rang some bells for me.

That couch is the first shot of many a porno. Generally, these videos tend to involve a woman walking in and sitting on the sofa, a seedy guy with a ponytail and big hands pretending to cast her for some photo shoot, her undressing, and the two of them eventually fucking over the desk. The article warned that if you immediately associated that black couch with porn you might have a problem.

I knew I had a problem.

Thing is, my problem wasn't that I was watching porn every day; it's that even if I wanted to I couldn't use my own brain to summon up fantasies. The internet was always right there, the sirens of PornHub singing their sweet song 24/7, lulling me in with their ballads of anal beads, BDSM, and bukkake. So why bother doing all the work myself?

At New Year's Eve, talking about resolutions, my friend Matteo said, ""You know what? I'm going to stop watching porn for a while. I need to detox."" He then told me that Milan—the city where we both live—has one of the highest per capita rates of porn consumption in Europe. The thought that I was contributing to this number—to this faceless army of fervent masturbators—was a uniquely depressing one.

""I'm going to stop, too,"" I said, with all the right intentions. The next day I watched some porn. However, when February rolled around I decided to start my mission in earnest.

I'd been watching porn on a very regular basis, clicking on RedTube or YouPorn or Tube8 most nights before going to sleep, or sometimes during the day if I was bored and felt like giving my wrist a bit of a workout. With that in mind, I assumed it would be hard to just cut myself off cold turkey, but for the first few days it was actually surprisingly easy. The closest thing I can equate it to is quitting smoking; not lighting up becomes a point of honor, a personal challenge, a battle you need to win in order to continue thinking of yourself as a decent human being.

This feeling—for the first couple of days, at least—was more pleasurable than the craving I'd decided to forego. I masturbated as I'd always done, and the novelty of using my mind again was exciting. I fantasized about ex-girlfriends and lovers and the things I'd always wanted to do but had been too shy to suggest. None of this was completely new, of course, but I'd never done it in such a systematic way. Now, every time I wanted to jerk off, I had to create a video of my own: concentrate, add details, flesh it out, give it a chronological order.

Feeling slightly self-righteous, I started to believe that the no-porn month laying ahead of me wasn't going to be so hard after all.

Turns out this confidence was premature.

The first—and most troubling—problem was my imagination. My fantasies quickly became repetitive: the same scenes, same places, same people, same bodies, same sex. I was unable to stretch my inventiveness any further than it had already been stretched. Each time I tried to expand on what I had, I fell back on what I already knew, like an old married couple going through the motions: lights off, missionary, leg cramp, a glass of water, silence.

Ten days into the experiment I stopped masturbating. However, I did still feel the need to orgasm. I'd forced blue balls on myself because I didn't want to undergo the process to achieve the end result. I soon realized—and this might seem quite bleak and obvious, but until you've experienced it firsthand it's hard to empathize with the concept—that using your imagination can be a bit of a chore. A chore I wasn't used to anymore.

I realize how lazy this sounds: a man who literally cannot be bothered to summon up a mental image of a naked woman. But the main problem I had was in synthesizing a sense of desire. I've been masturbating for roughly 15 years, and in this time porn has become a sad surrogate for lust—thousands of videos, most of them blurring into one image of a dick mechanically entering and exiting a vagina, helping me create what was missing. Dejected, I recognized the fact that I had rarely used my mind to orgasm in nearly a decade and a half.

Jesus, that fucking sentence.

Thankfully, this second phase slowly came to an end. The next step was a welcome return of natural desire: For the first time it was about my body, not my head. It was something I hadn't experienced before, or at least couldn't remember experiencing.

Before I quit watching porn, the pattern was as follows:

I felt like jerking off. I went on a porn site. I found a video. I jerked off.

None of the process felt organic, which is probably because it wasn't. The porn was just one step in a tedious, familiar plan, helping me to achieve something I'd already mapped out in my mind. Now it had gone back to some thought or image randomly awaking a sexual desire, me fantasizing about something, and then masturbating. Much better.

I also noticed that, for the first time, I wasn't thinking about anything in particular. Not the French couple, not the threesome in an Ikea-furnished bungalow, not the college orgy—rather about physical sensations and actually being able to appreciate them. It was more similar to sex than any of the many, many times I'd previously jerked off.

I shared my thoughts with a friend. She told me—and it was the most obvious thing in the world to her—that when she masturbated it was rarely to a defined set of images. That it was more about creating a sensation. She also underlined something I'd never noticed before, despite having watched thousands of porn videos throughout my life.

""In 80 percent of porn there are no hands involved,"" she said.

""What do you mean no hands?""

""I mean no hands. Exactly that.""

The need to show penetration and to focus on the woman means that all the acts we associate with good sex—hands, grabbing, hugging, pulling—are eliminated in favor of getting the best angles. Sex without what makes sex great.

After that little lesson, I noticed a substantial improvement in my orgasms. Before I stopped watching porn, as I came there would be a moment when the sensation peaked, before quickly disappearing and leaving little trace. But not any more. Coming lasted for much longer. As it happened, the sensation lingered throughout my body. I felt much more involved.

If, before, I clicked on a video, skipped through it, found a scene I liked, came, and quickly closed the computer to hide my embarrassment, I was now taking my time. That sinister post-masturbatory depression was gone.

A little over a month has passed, and I've decided to continue with the no-porn jerking off policy. I don't know how long I'll last, because you can basically keep anything up for a month without it becoming too much of an issue. It's in the post-honeymoon stage that it starts to become a little more difficult, when the novelty of the challenge wears off and the power of a well-established pattern starts playing on your mind.

I reckon I'll be able to keep on going for a long while yet, but I'm also realistic about how easy it would be to slip back into it. I guess it's like smoking a cigarette after you've quit: The first couple of drags taste awful, but give it a couple more and you'll be hooked once again.",human,human-written

"How Two Creative Teams Are Shaking up Salt

These repeat creators are collaborating on a magazine and design object that celebrate the historical significance of a simple but universal ingredient.

The creators of Salty, a design vessel and magazine celebrating salt.

If your holiday meal planning doesn’t require some creative accommodations for allergies and dietary restrictions, congratulations. But for many of us, these year-end times of coming together also highlight diverse dining habits.

That’s what Kristen Taylor was thinking about when she came up with the idea for Salty, a magazine and design vessel (live on Kickstarter now) that celebrates an ancient and near-universal ingredient: salt.

The Salty project includes a 100-page magazine about how salt is used around the world and a design vessel for your own table-side adventures.

“I’ve been thinking about how we do and don’t eat together as friends and as family. It’s harder because people have so many different diets — you become allergic to something, or you don’t eat gluten, or you’re running a marathon and eat differently for a while. There are all these ways that eating together has become fragmented,” Taylor explains. “So I was looking into the foods that we all need, the ways we need to eat together. And salt is universal. Our bodies need it; our brains need it to function every day.”

Taylor is the creator of the independent print magazine Saucy and an alumna of Al Jazeera, PBS, and the podcast Serial. So she knew she wanted to create a magazine telling the story of salt’s significance around the world—from indigenous eating habits to community salt hotels to family salt production plots (plus lots of recipes). But she also thought her project could have a deeper impact if it included a physical object for readers to use at home.

“I got really obsessed with salt, and I wanted to make it more visible — something that you think about all the time.”

So she called her friends Che-Wei Wang and Taylor Levy.

The husband and wife team behind the design studio CW&T are graduates of NYU’s ITP program, where Taylor used to teach. But the duo really came onto her radar when she backed their Kickstarter project for the Pen Type-A in 2011. “I fell in love with how they think and how they design. I’ve been a superfan ever since.”

Since that first project, CW&T has launched six additional Kickstarter campaigns that solidified the studio’s reputation for making beautiful, long-lasting everyday objects. So Taylor came to them with a salty proposition: she’d research and produce a magazine, and they’d prototype and fabricate the accompanying salt vessel.

“We had never really thought about working in food before,” says Levy. “We make things like pens and timepieces, precision machined and engineered to last multiple generations, to suggest you pay attention to what is otherwise ordinary. Salt is one of those everyday things, but if you look at it closely, it’s really quite extraordinary.”

The salt holder they designed references the nef, a small silver or golden container that was set in front of honored guests at medieval banquets. Salt was so prized at the time that nefs were typically fashioned to look like tiny, ornate replicas of sailing ships, and often featured a secret drawer for the coveted commodity.

CW&T’s take on the nef still references sailing ships, but in a much sleeker shape.

“When Kristen first showed us ancient salt nefs, we were blown away — mostly because we could never imagine something so ornate living on our table. So we iterated a ton,” explains Levy. “The one thing that stayed, in a sense, was the idea of a hidden compartment. To access the salt, you swipe a disc to reveal a hole in a smooth, pill-shaped surface. What you don’t see is that below the surface, the entire body of the vessel is filled with salt.”

The design celebrates salt’s history, but also how it travels around the world—and around the table. “Part of the beauty of the sliding lid is that it has movement in it,” says Taylor. “You pass the vessel at the table. You move it from the kitchen to the table. It’s always moving. And that’s the same thing that we were trying to bring out in the magazine. I went to six different countries and explored how salt moves in our daily lives, but also around the world.”",human,human-written

"But then self-doubt crept in. I started thinking of all the potential readers who would disagree with my post and rage on me in the comments.

First of all, I don’t have a degree in psychology. What if people jumped into the comments and told me I’m not qualified to write about the topic? I had seen it happen with other people’s articles on narcissism, even though I had gained considerable insight and value from what the authors wrote.

Second, there’s a school of thought that says, we should love the narcissists for their flaws, and not speak badly of them. Well, we should also love the victims. Those of us who have experience can save potential victims years of confusion and frustration. Still, though, it was an argument I didn’t care to have in the comments section of a post.

Third, I worried narcissists themselves would get on the comments and rage at me, bash me, even threaten me. By exposing who they are and how they act, I represent a threat to their way of life.

Fourth and finally, I come from the southern U.S. where every discussion seems to turn into a matter of race. Would someone claim I am using a racist term by writing about “White Knight” narcissism (as compared to the classic “Dark Knight” type of narcissist)? I was just using the term coined by the expert, and I certainly never intended it to be racist, but I felt I had to be worried someone would interpret it that way.

How to overcome your self-doubt as a writer

Below are three strategies I used to overcome my fear of criticism. I went on to publish my article on White Knight narcissism, which has become one of my three most successful articles this month.

Your haters don’t know you; to them, you’re just a symbol

Haters, for the most part, are people who are going through life with an ax to grind. They’re going to spew their venom on someone. In this case, it just happened to be your post that supplied the necessary trigger they were seeking. If it hadn’t been you, they would have raged on someone else who unknowingly fueled their fire.

Look. If someone’s exposure to who you are is limited to a 5-minute article they read on a website, they don’t know you. Rather, you symbolize whatever perceived injustice gets them up on their soapbox.

When someone has a vast overreaction to what you have to say, they’re not telling you something about yourself — they’re telling you something about themselves. Specifically, they’re telling you that they don’t deserve even another second of your time, so close their comment without responding, take a moment to cleanse your energy if you feel the need, and move on.

If everybody likes you, you are doing it wrong. — Ben Michaels

What would your writing coach tell you?

What’s that? You don’t have a writing coach? Yeah, me neither. At least not one I can see.

What I’ve learned to do, and what I would advise you to try as well when you encounter resistance when writing, is to imagine your best future writing self 6 to 12 months from now. Imagine the writer who has many published stories and successes under their belt. What would that version of you tell you to do?

Do you really think that future self would tell you, “Naaah, don’t write that, there might be one person out there somewhere who would disagree with what you have to say. You wouldn’t want to offend them.” Of course not! So step into that best future self.

Credit where credit is due: I got the idea to check in with my future writing self from If You Ask Yourself This Question Every Single Day, You’ll Be Ahead of 99% by Sinem Gunel. It’s most definitely worth 4 minutes of your time if you need help getting unstuck.

Write for your biggest fans

Imagine that you have people out there who visit your profile page every day. They’ve come to see if you’ve posted anything new today, because they’re eager to read anything that you, one of their favorite writers, has to say.

What? You don’t have readers like that? Can you prove it?

Several times on this and other platforms, I have been pleasantly surprised to discover I did have those kinds of fans, and didn’t know it.

So why not write for them?

I’ll let you in on a little secret: If you write for those fans, even if you don’t currently have them, you soon will. Your enthusiasm will be contagious and people will want to read more from you. Doesn’t that sound like a better strategy than writing for trolls and haters?

In summary

Writers, like any other kind of human, are subject to bouts of self-doubt and fear of criticism. Not only is it hard to get unwarranted criticism out of your head, but it’s also easy to imagine future unwarranted criticism that can make you question whether you should publish some of your best work. Uncertainty presents the ego-driven mind an opportunity to fill in the blanks with things that could go wrong.

There are strategies, however, to silence the mind. If you worry about unwarranted criticism, realize the critics see you as a symbol and that they are commenting on themselves far more than they are you.

Learn to reach out to your best future self as a writer, to connect with that best version of yourself, and to draw on their wisdom for guidance.

Finally, imagine that you’re writing for your most dedicated fans, even if you think you don’t have any — you may be wrong, and if you don’t currently have such fans, you will soon if you keep expressing your best self.

"One of the most persistent storylines continuing to dog the Dallas Cowboys is the notion of the December swoon. If you've been following the Cowboys headlines over the last couple of years, you'll know that the story has gained an almost mythic quality: as soon as the calendar turns to December, the Cowboys are expected to collapse.

More specifically, the Cowboys' high profile quarterback is expected to collapse come December. By now, you'll know that Tony Romo owns November but has struggled in December - or so you may have been led to believe.

It is true that Tony Romo has done exceptionally well in November. Over his career, he has accumulated a 21-4 record and a 108.5 passer rating in November. But December is a different story, right? One of the more nefarious allegations that live on like the undead in the darkest recesses of a prison compound in Georgia is that Romo sucks in December. Irrefutable fact or vicious slander?

Yesterday, our own KD Drummond pointed out via Twitter that ""Tony Romo has thrown 18 TDs & only 1 pick in his last 8 Dec games (09-current)... but you know what the meme is.""

That made me sit up, because I wasn't aware of that particular stat line. And when Carlos Mendez from the Star-Telegram replied to KD's tweet saying that he was writing a story on that exact topic for today, I decided to set the stat hound loose to sniff out the truth.

As KD pointed out, Romo has played eight full December games since 2009: four in 2009; none in 2010 as he sat out with a broken collarbone; three in 2011 (plus two pass attempts against the Eagles before injuring his throwing hand); and one more last Sunday against the Eagles. Over those 8 games and two pass attempts, Romo has thrown for 2,411 yards, 18 TDs and 1 INT on 201-for-289 passing (69.6%). That gives Romo a passer rating of 114.1 for December from 2009-2012.

Want to know how that compares to the other QBs across the league? Here you go:

December Passer Rating 2009-2012, min. 250 pass attempts QB Passer Rating CMP ATT Yds CMP% YPA TD INT Tony Romo 114.1 201 289 2,411 69.6% 8.3 18 1 Aaron Rodgers 106.1 243 388 3,265 62.6% 8.4 27 6 Tom Brady 105.7 275 425 3,432 64.7% 8.1 28 6 Philip Rivers 101.1 288 435 3,635 66.2% 8.4 23 9 Drew Brees 98.9 385 547 4,113 70.4% 7.5 30 15 Peyton Manning 95.6 214 320 2,324 66.9% 7.3 21 11 Matt Schaub 93.6 228 357 2,797 63.9% 7.8 16 8 Ben Roethlisberger 92.0 226 370 3,122 61.1% 8.4 13 7 Jason Campbell 91.2 160 251 1,890 63.7% 7.5 11 6 Joe Flacco 87.0 206 361 2,473 57.1% 6.9 22 10 Carson Palmer 85.9 275 431 3,147 63.8% 7.3 19 15 Eli Manning 85.6 265 453 3,643 58.5% 8.0 23 17 Matt Ryan 85.5 220 399 2,505 55.1% 6.3 21 6 Alex Smith 83.4 199 336 2,216 59.2% 6.6 12 6 Kyle Orton 76.5 162 278 1,806 58.3% 6.5 9 8 Josh Freeman 74.6 229 389 2,670 58.9% 6.9 14 16 Chad Henne 70.4 215 362 2,217 59.4% 6.1 9 13 Ryan Fitzpatrick 69.5 198 350 2,224 56.6% 6.4 11 14 Matt Hasselbeck 63.8 224 357 2,265 62.7% 6.3 8 21 Mark Sanchez 62.6 201 368 2,106 54.6% 5.7 9 15

Tony Romo has the best quarterback rating of any NFL quarterback in December over the last four years. That's indisputable. And just like we did in our look at QB Trifecta performances yesterday, we once again find the usual suspects (Peyton, Brees, Brady and Rodgers) at the top of the leaderboard - right behind Tony Romo.

The December meme is such a convenient hook that many pundits and fans alike have taken it at face value without giving the matter further thought. But a closer look at the stats shows that as good as Romo has been in November, over the last four years he's been even better in December.

Yet as good as Romo has been - and let's be very clear here: no QB has been better - the Cowboys only managed a paltry 4-4 record in the eight full December games Romo played from 2009-2012. That's pitiful. And it's also a clear illustration that as good as your QB may be, football is still a team game.

In his story for the Star-Telegram, appropriately titled ""Romo strong in December, Cowboys not so much"", Mendez quotes Tony Romo:

""Statistics? It's about winning and losing,"" Romo said. ""Stats are just there for people to talk about. I understand that. My team does. As long as we keep winning, that's a good sign.""

So let's talk about it: The Cowboys have four more games left in December this year. They are entering those four games with a QB who has outperformed every other NFL QB down the stretch over the last four years - and that includes future HoF locks like Manning, Rodgers and Brady, as well as Dilfer-type Super Bowl winners like Roethlisberger and Eli Manning - but will it be enough?

Can and will the rest of the Cowboys play up to Romo's standards?",human,human-written

It's hard to convey the excitement and performance of a supercar with a piece of furniture, but John & Table has tried.
The company's Race table is made of carbon fiber, and trimmed in leather and Alcantara. So it does have something in common with quite a few high-end performance cars.
It also features a price tag worthy of a Lamborghini. The Race costs 38,800 euros, or about $52,209 at current exchange rates and--unlike an Aventador--it probably won't offer much more performance than its mainstream counterpart.
Granted, each table is custom-built in Germany to individual specifications. Perhaps it's a similar process to being measured and fitted for a custom race seat, or maybe John & Table just asks measurements of the room.
Then there's all that carbon fiber. The entire table top is made of it, which John & Table says eliminates the need for a center beam. If moving truck racing ever takes off, the teams will probably want to get a few of these.
John & Table carbon fiber office furnitureJohn & Table also offers a race-inspired carbon fiber office chair to go with its creation (also available in Sterling silver and 24-karat gold), but why stop there?
If one high-performance table isn't enough, there's always the Lamborghini desk from Polish manufacturer RETRO that looks like the front end of a Murcielago, or the one from Bugatti that looks like a robot. They might clash with your Ferrari desk chairs, though.
Soon, it just might be possible to furnish an entire house with car-themed items. That would be the fastest house on the block.

"NBA norms have been upended like virtually everything else this pandemic-plagued year. The 2020-21 NBA season is set to start Dec. 22, just two months after the conclusion of the interrupted 2019-20 season.



The number of games will be reduced again—the league is aiming for a 72-game season running through May 16—but teams will return to playing in their home arenas (and receive daily COVID-19 testing), with the exception of the Toronto Raptors, who will play indefinitely in Tampa, FL, due to Canada’s COVID-19 restrictions.



Updated December 16, 2020 to report all your streaming options for the 2020-21 NBA season.



Although there has been talk of teams allowing some fans back in the stands, the safest place to view games this season if from your own home. Fortunately, there are plenty of options for cable cutters to stream games. As in the past, big matchups will be broadcast nationally on ABC, ESPN/ESPN2, TNT, and NBA TV; you can get most, if not all, of these covered with a single streaming package.



Unfortunately, the same can’t be said for the regional sports networks (RSNs) that air the bulk of teams’ games. Fox Sports, NBC Sports, YES Network, Marquee Sports Network, and other RSNs have been dropped from YouTube TV, Hulu With Live TV, Sling TV, and fuboTV, because of disputes with providers. If you’re mainly interested in following your local team through the season, your best bet is to determine which streaming service has an agreement with your team’s regional network and go with that one. Chances are it will also stream some or all of the cable networks mentioned above. A few teams can still be found on over-the-air channels—the Chicago Bulls on the windy city’s WGN, for one—but that arrangement is rapidly going the way of the two-handed set shot.



Over the air Martyn Williams/IDG Winegard’s Flatwave Amped antenna (model number FL-5500A) is one of our favorite indoor antennas.



The good news is you can access ABC for free if you have an over-the-air TV antenna (you’ll find our top antenna picks here) and are within the radius of a local ABC affiliate’s broadcast tower. The bad news is the network is scheduled to air only 10 of this year’s nationally televised games. These, however, include some of the league’s marquee matchups, including three Christmas Day games: Warriors vs. Bucks, Nets vs. Celtics, and Mavericks vs. Lakers.



You can watch the remaining games with some combination of the following services.



Sling TVThe easiest way to catch many of the cable telecasts is with the Sling TV streaming service, but you’ll need to pony up for a monthly subscription. For $30 per month, Sling’s Orange package will get you ESPN/ESPN 2 and TNT. With a digital antenna to catch the ABC broadcasts, that leaves only the NBA TV games to account for.



AT&T TV NowYou can also get ABC, ESPN, ESPN2 and TNT with AT&T TV Now. All you need is the basic Plus package for $55 per month. But upgrading to the $80-per-month Max package will get you those networks as well as a host of regional sports networks including NBC Sports, YES Network, MSG Network, and Fox Sports.



Hulu with Live TV and YouTube TVBoth Hulu with Live TV and YouTube TV give you access to ABC, ESPN/ESPN2, and TNT, though as with other services, the exact channel lineup varies by market. But only YouTube TV offers NBA TV, making its slightly higher monthly price—$65 per month compared to Hulu with Live TV’s $55 subscription—worth the expense for hoops fans. With only the one channel package, though, you don’t get the customizability of Sling TV or AT&T TV Now, so keep that in mind if you plan to use your subscription beyond basketball season.



Jared Newman / TechHive YouTube TV uses a small number of menu sections to make navigation easier.



FuboTVFuboTV recently added ABC and the ESPN channels to both its Family and Elite bundles. Unfortunately, it also dropped TNT, and earlier in the year, Fox Regional Sports networks. If you’re a fan of the Kings, Warriors, Lakers, or Clippers, you might want to opt for the $80-per-month Elite package as it also includes regional networks NBC Sports Bay Area and NBC Sports California. You can add NBA TV by purchasing the Sports Plus add-on for an extra $11 per month.



FuboTV Fubo has lots of appeal to sports fans, and it includes NBA TV. But your subscription won’t give you access to ABC, TNT, or ESPN.



NBA League PassIf you’re truly hardcore for the hardwood, you should consider a subscription to NBA League Pass, the league’s official streaming service. For $200 a year or $29 per month, you can watch every live out-of-market game that isn’t being broadcast nationally on one of the four networks we’ve mentioned.



A League Pass subscription allows you to watch up to four games at once in HD, and it works on computers, tablets, smartphones, and streaming devices. Games originally broadcast on ESPN, TNT, and ABC are available 24 hours after completion in the video archives. You also get anytime access to a curated selection of “classic” games.



For $250 a year or $40 per month, you can upgrade to NBA League Pass Premium, which adds an in-arena stream during game breaks.



NBA Media Ventures, LLC. With an NBA League Pass subscription, you can stream live out-of-market games to your TV, computer, or mobile device.



NBA Team PassTwo bills is a big investment if you only want to follow your favorite team. NBA Team Pass is one less-expensive alternative. For $120 a year or $18 per month, you get access to all your squad’s local broadcasts for both home and away games.



The rub is that NBA blackout rules still apply. If you live in your team’s “home” market—a Warriors fan residing in the Bay Area, for example—you still won’t be able to watch their games even with a Team Pass subscription (this goes for League Pass as well). Your team’s home market, however, isn’t necessarily defined by your town’s city limits.



In the NBA’s own words, the league determines blackout zones “using zip code (if watching via a satellite television provider), a combination of zip code and cable system distribution territory (if watching via a cable television provider), or by the IP address associated with your internet connection or your mobile device’s GPS coordinates.”



What that means is this isn’t a cord-cutting option for everyone. The only way to be sure of your situation is to enter your zip code in the Blackout Notice in the middle of this page before you sign up for one of the NBA subscriptions.



NBA streaming is still 50-50 ballStreaming live NBA games continues to be a mixed bag for cord-cutters. The availability of national broadcasts through streaming services gives you a courtside seat for some of the biggest matchups of the season. But local fanbases who want to follow their team continue to be left on the bench, for the most part. Until streaming options for regional sports networks become more widely available, you might want to dust off your radio.

"Hollywood isn’t the grail I thought it was.

.

Johnny Depp:

“I’m never not shocked at the..ah..at the support and the warmth, and the love and reception…and people thanking me for something that I should be thanking them for. This is a way to be able to say thank you to the people who pay all of our salaries.” — 47th Deauville American Film Festival

From an France 24 interview with Johnny :

F24: “And despite public opinion in other places, France has always loved you back, as well. Why do you think France is different to maybe Hollywood, for example?

JD: “Than Hollywood? (laughs) um, um, there’s no, there’s just no comparison. The appreciation for, and I use the term cinema, there’s a great difference now…to what’s considered films-cinema, and movies. Um, Hollywood …seems to make movies that are continually, constantly, endlessly, boringly fractured and formulaic stories. Here? Anything’s possible?

We’ve been duped!

I have been blaming Covid for the spanner in the works of the film industry. In New Zealand, borders closed and people came home through a one way valve. A country of travellers got very, very full. I feel the cabin-fever. We have few big names in film here but really, we’re governed by this idea that the bigger studios in Hollywood are the mecca we should all turn to for an injection of $$ to keep the wheels turning. And Amazon has just bugged out, moving their LOTR TV show to the UK. In New Zealand things are done a bit differently with our Govt providing some funds towards the making of films, though the parameters can be restrictive so crowdfunding has become something to explore, and yet for the most part, we’ve all still missed the point. Crowdfunding.

That’s what those big studios are — Hollywood Corporations built on crowdfunding from all those films made and sold to the awed masses who handed over their hard earned cash and accepted that Hollywood knew what was best for them. The people trusted the studio to do right by them. And did Hollywood take advantage of this? Yes. The money poured in. How much has been hustled to create a film that, in all fairness, is one of the biggest risks you can take…but with so many compliant consumers, the risk becomes worth it. The mega budget films are made with money and debt, borrowing against the projected return of the volume of sales… until the balance of power tips.

It becomes a scapegoat-fest for the bigwigs in their towers, looking down at the kingdom they’ve built on the backs of hardworking small. The sort of Wigs who climb up the ranks forgetting about the rungs of the ladder not within their immediate vicinity. While in their positions of power, they lorded it. And like a casino, the house always wins. Who tipped the scales?

Crowdfunding built Hollywood; people making films for people.

Did Hollywood ever actually forget this or is this the dirty secret they’ve known all along and have been hiding it, burying it where they keep the other things they don’t want people to see. Did they delude themselves into believing that the people were a product too? The truth is, it’s not only YOU PEOPLE in control, but WE PEOPLE together in this. A worldwide crowdfunding cooperative and this power can quite literally implode Hollywood in on themselves, giving them the heavy-duty kick in the arse.

Pre-production, then actors bring the talent to the screen while they work the 10–12hrs plus per day with Crew on a Set to shoot the film. Then post-production, editing the footage for your eyes on screen. Skilled, hard working people in a well-oiled machine. People collaborating towards that goal to complete their best work for their production house, who get their money from…the people…. who will pay to see this film. There is so much passion down here on the floor, the workers would pay to see the film too.

You, the honeypot money-pool Hollywood has been banking on, has realised that you have the power to change things. Bend the spoon you might say. But was the spoon ever really there? … It’s a rather humbling feeling, this shift in perspective and I begin to understand Johnny’s profound gratitude for an industry funded by YOU. I am humbled…and Zen-ing out here, while I’ve been wading through jelly towards this film production grail that doesn’t actually exist, I’ve also been duped. To aim for Hollywood isn’t actually aiming high at all, rather it’s like a consolation prize with a dull tasting conformity and complicity.

As small as my voice is, I know that I have said way more than some would dare. Even down here, in my pocket of the world. It’s not a good feeling to pander to the powers that be, to stay quiet so as to be able to step forward and not lose my place on the ladder so many here are scrambling for. I wish borders would open soon and the world could get back to some normality. Because in spite of all of this, I want to help tell beautiful cinematic stories, where CGI doesn’t dominate the entire film and something is left for the imagination - where anything is possible!",human,human-written
"The words of 2020

2020 was not a vintage year. You were more likely to finish Netflix than see your grandparents. However, it did inspire a few new additions to the English language. Michael Davies Dec 24, 2020·3 min read

Pixabay

A note on these words: they are either portmanteaus (a mixture of two words), words that have been around for a while and have found new meaning or words with added prefixes to change their meaning somewhat.

Covidiot

We can thank portmanteaus for providing the English language with many annoying words such as brunch, chillax and Brexit. It’s latest gift was a mixture of covid-19 and idiot that perfectly sums up those peculiar people who feel that the virus is some made-up idea by the mainstream media in collaboration with Bill Gates and George Soros to keep us all in our homes while mutant lizards take over the world. Or something.

Karen

Having known several Karens who do not fit the definition, I was loath to include this but it has featured far too heavily in the media to be left out. A karen is someone who behaves obnoxiously and acts as if the world owes her a favour. The word became popular when Amy Cooper threatened to call the police to attend to a black man who had told her that her dog had to be on a lead in Central Park. He filmed the entire incident and she lost her well-paid job as a result.

Zoom

I’m still to be converted to the merits of Zoom as I am unsure of the difference between it and Skype; the name of an American company that few people had heard of last year now appears to be the definitive word for video conferencing. It has yet to reach verb-like status in the same way as to google but I am sure it’s only a matter of time.

Malarkey

A word inspired not by covid-19 but by Joe Biden, malarkey is an old-fashioned word meaning nonsense. Whether the 46th President of the United States manages to popularise it in 2021 is one for the futurists. It’s a fun word and I hope he succeeds.

Defund

In the US, there was frequent talk of defunding the police while in the UK people on the extreme right and extreme left would occasionally call for the BBC to be defunded if a reporter said something that they didn’t agree with. While the word is more nuanced than simply suggesting that funding should be taken away from a public body, few people recognise that.

Lockdown

The only time we had ever heard of a lockdown pre-2020 was when it featured in a prison movie. By the end of 2020, we were all Sylvester Stallone trying to break out of jail for a quick trip to the shop.

Doomscrolling

As most of the world seemed to be confined to their houses for large parts of 2020, there was very little one could do except reach for your mobile and see how bad things were outside. Doomscrolling is the act of looking through endless news stories on your phone about the number of people in hospital, the various mutations of the virus, the number of businesses that were closing and the number of deaths. It is not recommended.

For more words of 2020, watch this video. If there are any you think that have been forgotten, let us know in the comments.

"DATA ON AWS

Caching in AWS

Repeat read access patterns have mandated the implementation of a caching layer in most modern applications. These access patterns might be for different use cases, such as configuration files, images, any file on a CDN. The idea behind caching is to store some items closer to the compute layer to avoid time spent on roundtrips and bandwidth limitations, usually resulting in sub-millisecond response times for building blazing fast applications.

Scaling up an application, you’ll find yourself in a situation where you’ll have to scale up all the components so that they synchronize well after the scaling up. For most businesses, it is better to use managed solutions implementing different layers of the application.

One such component is the cache. Caches are used everywhere — in your browser, in your mobile apps, when you’re streaming audio, and when you’re watching a YouTube video. It’s important to understand that what we’ll be talking about in this post is server-side caches and not client-side caches.

Caches are usually implemented using high-speed volatile devices such as RAMs. To implement a cache, you can use one of many cache algorithms or cache replacement policies. Two of the most popular OSS caching projects that allow you to do that is — Redis and Memcached. AWS’s ElastiCache supports both these projects.

A cache doesn’t necessarily have to be in-memory. You can use a fast SSD as a cache for a slow HDD with a rotating disk if you think about it. Anything with higher IO and lower latency can be used as a cache. That’s why services like DynamoDB are used as caches too. And then, there are in-memory tables in relational and non-relational databases, which use a part of the RAM to store data. We’ll talk about these different services in this post.

ElastiCache for Redis & Memcached

AWS ElastiCache is a caching service that supports both Redis and Memcached engines. Both Redis and Memcached have a baseline of standard features but provide enough unique features to have separate use cases for both. We’ll delve into the architecture and AWS-managed features for both of these caches in the upcoming posts.

Memcached is a multi-threaded, in-memory key-value store that supports caching of simple data types. Memcached is meant just for caching simple string objects up to 1 MB in size. Redis, on the other hand, is much more than a cache. Redis can store advanced data types such as hashes, lists, and sorted sets. One other significant difference between these two is that Redis supports persistence on disk, enabling you to store long-lived data or reload your cache in case of a server restart.

These caches can support many use cases, including storing and processing data from streaming platforms, leaderboards, IoT devices, etc. For example, Redis is increasingly being used for high-speed geospatial data storage and processing.

As mentioned earlier, you can use these caches to improve the response times of an application drastically. For new data, rather than going to the database first and writing it, you can write it to a cache first and serve any following read requests from the cache itself. For older data, when something is requested after a long time, you can bring it to the cache for any further requests.

DynamoDB

Caching doesn’t start and end with Redis and Memcached. DynamoDB is a multi-purpose, serverless, key-value database used both as a key-value-cum-document store and a cache. For simple applications, you can use DynamoDB to store configuration files for your application. For high volume, complex applications like gaming platforms, you can use DynamoDB to store session information, leaderboards, etc.

Although DynamoDB supports storing JSON data, don’t use it as a replacement of MongoDB on AWS. For availing all the capabilities of MongoDB on AWS, use DocumentDB.

Data engineers can use DynamoDB to store data pipeline and orchestration metadata to enable replayability. ML engineers can use DynamoDB to feed data into SageMaker for real-time predictions and analysis. With DynamoDB being a much more flexible product than an in-memory cache, many use cases have a much wider array. I wrote about my experience using DynamoDB about two years ago:

In-Memory Tables in Databases

Having used relational databases extensively, I have to mention that I haven’t seen a complex application using only a single caching solution. Databases use the same caching mechanisms in the form of buffer memory. The idea is to keep as much of the database within memory as possible. For faster reads and writes of non-critical data, say, when you’re processing data for an ETL job using pure SQL, you can use in-memory tables. Keep in mind that these tables aren’t durable. Everything in the buffer memory of a database goes away if the server is restarted. The buffer is warmed up again when you start querying the database again.

Using memory-based tables brings us back to the concept of using anything which has higher IO and lower latency than your next closest storage medium as a cache. And that’s exactly what memory tables are used for.

What’s Next?

This was the third post in a long series of posts about data-related services on AWS. Previously, I have talked about RDS in detail. The last post was about specialty (purpose-built) databases on AWS.

"When looking to buy a gaming mouse you often see them advertised with the specification Polling Rate. The most common question regarding this is what does it mean and how useful is it. This specification is not be mixed up with DPI

Polling Rate Explained

Polling rate is a specification which is mostly found on gaming mice. Polling Rate is measured in Hertz or HZ in short. Polling rate will help us gamers understand how fast the mouse will respond when connected to our computer.

A mouse’s polling rate will determine how often it will report its position to the computer. This means that if a mouse has 125HZ it will report its position to the computer 125 times every second or every 8 milliseconds and if the mouse has 500HZ it will report its position to the computer every 2 milliseconds.

A gaming mouse which has a high polling rate can decrease the input lag that occurs when you move your mouse, this means that when you move your mouse the inputs will be shown with less input lag on your screen. It is also important to understand that a high polling rate will also use more CPU resources on your computer as the CPU has to create more queries for the mouse to read its position.

Gaming mice today support a high polling rate out of the box and often come with software that will allow the end user to change to polling rate or else the mouse will have a switch which will allow the end user to change the polling rate on the fly.",human,human-written

BMN sells out in two minutes, Fidelity lobbying for BTC ETF, Cathie Wood reiterates $500k price target, Coinbase bonds oversubscribed, MicroStrategy sells stock to boost BTC war chest, and El Salvador promises foreigners no tax on BTC Blockstream Follow Sep 17 · 7 min read

By Jesse Knutson

Bounce

Bitcoin is on pace to reclaim about half the ground lost last week and tracking the seventh weekly gain of the past ten.

Major stonks indices ended the week near the top end of their historic range as gold dropped through its 50-day moving average to a one-month low, the USD strengthened and the CNY continued to drift lower as the domestic real estate crisis unfolds.

Bitcoin, technically, continues to look interesting as the volatility squeeze highlighted over the previous two weeks continues to play out. Onchain data, fund flows and funding rates also look supportive.

The herd is coming

Blocksteam followed up on a string of positive headlines over the past few weeks with the successful completion of tranche three of the Blockstream Mining Note. Today’s tranche saw $5.5M of BMN orders filled in under two minutes.

Outside of that, news flow this week was led by institutional and corporate headlines with reports that Fidelity had met with the SEC to pitch its BTC ETF application, Cathie Wood reiterating her $500,000 Bitcoin target price, Coinbase junk bonds ~5x oversubscribed, and MicroStrategy reportedly selling $400M in stock to boost its Bitcoin holdings.

Canary in the CNY coal mine?

There’s a big bubble bursting in China, and it’s not Bitcoin.

The ongoing Evergrande saga is massive in scale: $300B in liabilities, commitments to complete 1.4 million properties, 16% of China’s total high-yield bond market, and swarms of disgruntled retail investors.

Evergrande is a systemically important company to China’s economy and the ripple effect could drive real pain; fire sales across real estate markets, evaporation of supply chain profit margins, and a nosedive in capital markets. The stakes are high and it’s unclear how this will be navigated.

China already has a lot on its plate with an ongoing economic slowdown, rising tensions with Western countries, and a crackdown on private sector companies from a broad range of industries — including Bitcoin.

I wonder if the Bitcoin crackdown is a canary in the coal mine, and perhaps part of a larger effort to tighten capital controls as the powers that be attempt to address escalating issues in China’s massive real estate market.

The surprise string of 2015 CNY devaluations took markets by surprise, and I think we’re a primary driver of Bitcoin’s grind higher in 2016 (chart below).

A repeat of that would be massively bullish for Bitcoin.

Cups, handles, and squeezes

Over the past two weeks, I’ve highlighted the volatility squeeze playing out and how last week’s dump was probably a head fake, so it’s encouraging to see price rebound back up around the 20-day moving average.

The overall setup continues to look supportive; Bitcoin saw +$60M in fund flows over the past two weeks and MicroStrategy buying has lifted BTC in corporate treasuries to around an all-time high, funding rates remain low, and charts on the crypto space as a whole look like they could be setting up for a broad-based break higher.

With both the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average sitting at $46,000, I think this is probably a fairly strong line of support. Just north of $52,000 marks both two standard deviations above the 20-day moving average and the price peak from a few weeks ago. This is probably the main line of near-term resistance.

Onchain data also looks increasingly positive, with indications that both small and large wallets are now pulling in the same direction for the first time in weeks.

What’s going on in China (Evergrande and real estate) is a bit off the Bitcoin radar at the moment, but could also be a massive Bitcoin price driver if it spills over into pressure on the CNY.

Remember 2016?",human,human-written
"Shortly after Pope Francis gave an homily in which he said even atheists who do good are redeemed, a statement from a Vatican spokesman clarified the pope's remarks.

Just one day after the pope's now famous words in Rome on May 22, a Vatican spokesman the Rev. Thomas Rosica released a statement quoting a section of the Catechism of the Catholic Church that says people who reject the teachings of Jesus Christ cannot attain salvation.

""All salvation comes from Christ, the Head, through the Church which is his body,"" Rosica wrote. ""Hence they cannot be saved who, knowing the Church as founded by Christ and necessary for salvation, would refuse to enter her or remain in her.""

However, Rosica wrote that it's not impossible for an atheist to eventually be saved by Christ.

“Rejection of Christianity may not mean the rejection of Christ,” he wrote. ""We can never say with ultimate certainty whether a non-Christian who has rejected Christianity...is still following the temporary path mapped out for his own salvation which is leading him to an encounter with God.”

Rosica's statement was written in response to the many calls and messages he received after Francis' controversial homily.

The Catholic Church defines redemption and salvation differently: while everyone is redeemed through the death of Jesus Christ, salvation is offered by God and can be either accepted or rejected individually.

In his homily, the pope said everyone, ""even the atheists,"" have been redeemed ""with the Blood of Christ,"" according to Vatican Radio.

""If we, each doing our own part, if we do good to others, if we meet there, doing good, and we go slowly, gently, little by little, we will make that culture of encounter,"" Francis said. ""We must meet one another doing good. 'But I don't believe, Father, I am an atheist!' But do good: we will meet one another there.""

The Vatican's statement seemed to attempt to do damage control for Francis' remarks, emphasizing that his job is more to speak well than to provide an indisputable interpretation of the Bible.

""[Pope Francis] is first and foremost a seasoned pastor and preacher who has much experience in reaching people,"" the statement said. ""His words are not spoken in the context of a theological faculty or academy nor in interreligious dialogue or debate.""",human,human-written
"Chapter 1 — Introduction

A reinforcement learning system has four main subelements:



- a policy

- a reward signal

- a value function

- and optionally, a model of the environment

Policy

The policy defines how the agent will behave in any given time. More formally, it’s a mapping from the states of the environment to actions to be taken when in those states.

Different states and the possible actions from them [ref]

For example, imagine that you’re in state S2. Notice that you can go to either state S3 (taking action a6), or stay in the same state S2 (take action a3). The policy tells that you should take action a6 and go to state S3.

So again, a policy π is a function that takes as an input a state “S” (S2 in our example) and returns an action “a” (a6 in our example).

That is: π(s) → a

Or in our example, π(S2) → a6

It’s also important to understand that the learner and decision-maker is called the agent. The thing it interacts with, comprising everything outside the agent, is called the environment.

The policy may look like a lookup table, a simple function, or it may involve extensive computation such as a search process.

Also, the policy alone is sufficient to determine the agent’s behavior.

Policies are usually stochastic, meaning that we select an action from a probability distribution.

As an example, imagine that we are state S2 again. The policy will not just tell the agent “take action a6”. Instead, it will say “take action a6 with probability 88%, and take action a3 with probability 12%”.

Reward signal

After every action that the agent takes, the environment sends it a single number, a reward. The reward that the agent receives depends on the agent’s action and the state. The agent’s only goal is to maximize the total reward it receives over the long run.

The reward signal thus tells the agent what are the good and what are the bad decisions (e.g. low reward = bad, high reward = good).

The reward signal is the primary basis for altering the policy. Meaning, if the policy tells the agent to select an action when it’s in specific state (e.g. choose action “a6” when you’re in state “S2”), and that action is followed by a low reward, then the policy may be changed to select some other action in that situation (i.e. state) in the future.

Value function

Whereas the reward signal indicates what’s good for the agent at the moment (e.g. taking action “a6” right now when the agent is on “S2), a value function specifies what is good in the long run.

The value function takes into account the states that are likely to follow, and the rewards available in those states.

The value of a state is the total amount of reward an agent can expect to accumulate over the future, starting from that state.

So going back to our example, the value of state S3 takes into account the fact that after going into S3, you could also go to states S1 and S4.

The value of state S2 takes into account the fact that after going into S2, you could also go to states S3 and S2.

It’s important because a state might always gives an agent a low immediate reward, but if that state have a high value, it means that it’s often followed by other states that yield high rewards (hence, the agent should still go to that state).

So for example, imagine again that the agent is at state S2, and that taking action “a3” yields a reward with a value of 5. And that taking the action “a6” yields a reward with a value of 3. Maybe the reason the policy told the agent to go to state S3 from state S2 (taking action “a6”) is that once the agent is on state S3, it can take action “a2” that yields a 100 reward value.

Rewards are given directly by the environment, but values must be estimated and re-estimated from the observations an agent makes over its lifetime. That is, because the value of a state will change depending on what the agent knows about futures possibilities from that state. And since the agent continuously explore, it will discover more possibilities.

Without rewards there will be no values, and the only reason to estimate values is to achieve more rewards in the long run. Hence, you can think about rewards as primary, and values as secondary (they are just used as predictions of future rewards).

Nevertheless, it’s values that we care about when making and evaluating decisions. We seek actions that bring us to states of highest value, not the highest reward, because these actions will provide us with the greatest amount of reward in the long run.

Model of the environment

The model of the environment is a model that mimics how the environment will behave.

For example, given a state and an action, the model might predict the next state and next reward.

Models are used for deciding on a course of actions, by taking into account possible future situations before they are actually experienced.

RL problems that use models are called model-based methods.

RL problems that don’t use models are called model-free methods. The agents here are explicitly trial-and-error learners.",human,human-written

The tale of the girl between the two doors

(See below article*)

“Between the two doors,” she’d said to my grandmother. And for days, the words echoed in her mind as she tried to make sense of it. What’s between the two doors? Which two doors? But no answer came; all was quiet for days. And then it came to her. The attic. The attic was the only place in the house where there was a space between two doors — the door at the bottom of the stairs, and the heavy trap door we had to push up to get into the airless space.

Armed with a flashlight and determination, she trekked up to the second floor once the children were off to school. It was an old house, full of cracks and nooks and crannies. She searched for nearly an hour and was about to give up when she heard the voice in her mind once more. “Between the two doors.” In desperation, she cried out loud, “There’s nothing between the two doors!”. This time an answer came. One word. “Look.”

She sighed and sat on one of the worn wooden steps, and then she saw the gap — how had she not seen it before? There was a gap, wide enough to slide her slender arm in. With the beam of the flashlight, she illuminated the web and dust-filled space until the beam landed on a square piece of yellowed paper. She could barely reach, but with the tips of her fingers, she managed to grab the edge and pull it up.

Her breath caught in her throat as she turned it over and saw it was an old photograph.

A small black and white print of a young girl of about three or four, with white-blond ringlets, sitting with her arms around what appeared to be her baby brother — a little boy of about one, in shorts and suspenders. What broke my grandmother’s heart was that the corner of the picture was torn, removing the baby’s head. Her breath caught as she swallowed the tears, and the words were barely a whisper. “This is you.” There was no answer, but she knew it to be the truth.",human,human-written

If you’ve been looking for a job for a little while now, you’ve probably already sent dozens, or maybe even hundreds, of job applications to employers. You might be feeling pretty frustrated if you haven’t really been getting many responses. Well, you’re in luck because in this article, I’m going to walk you through the four reasons why employers aren’t calling you back, and exactly what you can do about it.

You’re not showing that you’re a true fit for the job

This is the biggest reason why employers are ignoring. You have probably not done the work of showcasing to them that you are the perfect job candidate. If you don’t do the work of showing to them that you’re a match for them, how can you possibly expect them to give you a call?

To break it down, there are actually three key areas where you potentially may not be showing that you’re a fit for the job. The first one is your resume or CV. Is your resume lacking a clear strategy? When you look at your own resume, do you feel that an employer who sees it would be like, ‘Oh my goodness, this person is the exact perfect fit for the job’? Or do you think they see it and go like, ‘Yeah maybe, not sure.. let’s see what else is out there.’ If you feel that there is room for improvement in your resume or CV, then you are most likely right.

Your resume is the ticket that will get you into the door. If you don’t know how to write your resume in an attractive and compelling way, your resume will simply be thrown to the side. You see, employers get hundreds of resumes all the time. You really need to make sure that your resume stands out from the rest.

The second place where you might not be showing that you are an attractive, high-quality candidate to the employer is in your LinkedIn profile. I know this may sound silly, but when was the last time you actually updated your photo on LinkedIn to not only be one that’s recent, but also one where it shows that you have a bright, energetic and cheerful personality? Your photo on your LinkedIn profile will either help to increase or decrease your chances of getting that initial phone call.

The third place where you’re likely not showcasing your value enough is in your interviews. If you have gotten called for a couple of interviews here and there, but you never got a call back to move forward to the next round, then there’s only one major reason for that. The reason is you’re not telling compelling enough stories in your interviews to the employers. Knowing how to tell compelling stories in your interviews is the key strategy to hooking the employer’s interest in you and getting them to choose you over anyone else. If you want them to give you the job, be sure to tell compelling stories.

Your job applications are not even being seen in the first place

If the only way that you’re applying for jobs is through online job applications, along with hundreds of other people who are also applying through the same job portals, there’s a good chance that employers aren’t even seeing your resume or application. If they can’t see you, they’re definitely not going to be able to hire you. So what do you do?

Firstly, you want to apply to only the freshest jobs — those that have only showed up within the first or second day. If you’re waiting to apply for a job and it’s been posted for a week or two, there’s a good chance that you’ve likely missed the boat. Apply for the jobs that show up right away. Strike them when they’re hot. Employers are likely to look at the actual applications that show up within the first one or two days. You have a higher chance of having your resume being seen by the employer if you apply straight away when a job is posted. Another way to get your job application be seen is to reach out to the employer directly.

You don’t believe that you’ll be able to get the job

No matter how much you want a job, if somewhere inside you’ve lost confidence in yourself and don’t believe that you’ll get the job that you want, then you probably really won’t be able to get it. The lack of belief that you have within yourself is actually what’s causing employers to also have that lack of belief in you.

Be extremely mindful of the thoughts that you’re telling yourself, and how they’re making you feel. If you want employers to change their mind about you and to see you differently, you need to see yourself differently. It all starts with you and ends with you. You need to change the way you feel about yourself. You need to see the value that you can offer to organizations, and then from there you’ll be able to express that in the interviews. That self belief is going to increase the chances of you getting your dream job offer.

You don’t have a hint of the relevant technical skills or qualifications

You need to have relevant skills, experiences and knowledge that can easily translate to the job that you want to get into. That doesn’t mean that you have to have done the exact job before, but if you have transferable skills, experiences and knowledge, those are going to help you increase your chances of getting the job offer. So if you have the required skills, you need to highlight them on your job applications and interviews.

Go after the positions that you really want to get, but also make sure that they align with the skill sets that you currently possess.",human,human-written
"Yes, I Want To Scream At People Who Defy COVID-19 Rules

I have been thinking about the recent viral audio clip of megastar Tom Cruise cursing at crew members who broke COVID-19 safety protocols on the London set of the next Mission: Impossible sequel.

He is clearly a dude with a temper and I relate to that. It’s also clear he’s quite practiced at bawling people out — you can bet he’s incinerated a hotel manager over the phone because the pillows in his suite weren’t properly fluffed.

I’m not suggesting I’m anything like Tom Cruise, by the way. I just identify with dudes blowing their fuses. I’m not a millionaire celebrity nor am I a Hollywood legend nor am I an Operating Thetan Level Eight. I’m just a man pointing at another man. I’m ashamed to admit it but I’ve gotten furious at people who did not deserve it.

But I’ve also, very rarely, been righteous. A guy can get lucky, you know?

In the leaked tape Cruise just goes apeshit on a pair of people who were standing too close together and not social distancing. For three whole minutes, Tom Cruise just goes off. “If I see you do it again you’re fucking gone,” he shouts. “We are creating thousands of jobs, you motherfuckers. I don’t ever want to see it again. Ever!”

He lambasts these two and everyone listening. The pandemic has ravaged many industries, including the film industry. The very lucrative Mission: Impossible movies are being made under strict rules. Not everyone is as fortunate as the cast and crew of Cruise’s blockbuster franchise.

COVID-19 is a disaster for Hollywood and Cruise’s set is a sport of elite experiment in safe filmmaking while a deadly global virus runs rampant.

During the rant Cruise makes great points, you know? As one of the executive producers, he’s responsible for the livings of a great number of people. These film productions are like entire mini-economies supporting hundreds of people, and their families. One positive COVID test could threaten the livelihoods of everyone involved.

But what I’ve been thinking about is how good it feels to get angry. Just listening, I felt a small rush. Fuck yeah, tell those knuckleheads off! They should be taking this seriously! That’s right, Tom, blast them. Fight the good fight.

There is a petty part of me that would love to go Hulk on dipshits who won’t wear a mask but like squirting ketchup on a shoe. You can smother a shoe in ketchup the way you do a hot dog but it’s still a shoe. In this metaphor, anger is ketchup.

And then I thought: How many times has he gotten pissed for no good reason. Which led me to my next thought bubble: How many times have I gotten bent out of shape just because I could?

I’m a man who wrestles with his anger. I am most comfortable with two emotions: One is anger and the other is grinding my teeth. For years I truly believed that anger was how you got things done. As if trains run on screams or phones can be charged wireless via tightly clenched fists. There was a part of me that wanted to believe that shaking a broken toaster would magically fix that toaster.

I once had an upstairs neighbor who would work out late at night using a noisy rowing machine. There were times I would literally shake my fist at the ceiling like I was trying to pick a fight with God while just vomiting profanities like hot lava. I would get so worked up and, you know, every time he’d just row faster.

That was years ago. LOL!

But I have learned in that time that my temper is a sort of poker tell. It’s how I know I’m scared or sad. There are many wonderful things about being a man but we are poorly served by society in many ways. So many. I can’t get into them all. One way is we’re told that anger is might. That an angry man is a force of nature. That he is strong. Those veins that pop out on your head when you’re losing your shit? They’re meat lightening, not potential signs of a cardiac event.

The truth is anger is the loss of control. It is the ugly face of weakness. When a person is lost in their rage they are lost emotionally. If you ever see me get mad you can bet I’m wrestling with feelings that I don’t know what to do with. I have spent years in therapy talking about how my anger keeps me from connecting with those I love. My anger has also nuked relationships with people I love. My anger has resulted in emotional casualties. I have said things while incensed that no apology can make right. There are some wounds that can’t be healed, at least not by the person who caused them. Trust me, life is lighter without those kinds of burdens/

I have made some progress over the years but I will spend the rest of my life slowly, mindfully, breathing in, and breathing out and trying not to say and do things I will regret.

I hope the Mission: Impossible movies finish filming without anyone getting sick. I actually like those movies. They have become, improbably, favorites of mine. I look forward to Ethan Hunt’s increasingly insane adventures the same way I eagerly anticipate new Batman and Bond films. I also love how these movies have turned 58-year-old Tom Cruise into a sort of super stunt man with perfect teeth.

But as an angry man, I have to listen to those tapes and wonder if there are other ways to deal with conflict or situations beyond your control. It is reasonable to express frustration if people who work for you are defying regulations meant to protect others. It is acceptable to warn them there are consequences!

I just think angry dudes should think twice before indulging in rage. And you know who you are. You’re probably a man, but dangerous tempers are not specific to just one gender. I do feel, however, that men are encouraged to play with anger more than women. I think men are raised to hide their fears and vulnerabilities behind fireballs of anger. But smacking around a broken toaster does not fix it. It just breaks it more.",human,human-written

Originally, Mazda planned to bring only 500 2019 MX-5 Miata 30th Anniversary Edition cars to the United States, but the automaker has decided to appease at least some of those who missed out.
On Tuesday, the company said it has allocated another 143 cars for U.S. buyers. The figure is still part of the 3,000 total cars Mazda plans for production globally.
The U.S. was the only market that offered pre-orders for the beautiful orange Miata, and the original batch of 500 cars sold out in only four hours. Mazda spokesman Tim Olsen told Motor Authority that the cars were planned to simply go to dealer lots in other countries. Since none of the cars are at dealers yet, the decision to add more cars to the U.S. allotment is likely just a thank you to loyal U.S. customers rather than an indication of a lack of interest in other markets. Now, 643 of the special-edition cars will be headed to American shores.
2019 Mazda MX-5 Miata 30th Anniversary Edition
Mazda placed fans who weren't able to snag one of the 500 original cars headed to the U.S. on a waitlist in hopes a slot would open up, should a previous buyer back out. We imagine 143 fans will be very excited to hear the news.
Mazda is splitting production of the 30th Anniversary Edition Miata between the soft-top roadster and the RF variant with a hard top. Those on the waitlist will get the body style they chose when they put in their pre-order, Olsen said. Previously, Mazda said 60 percent of American buyers opted for the soft-top roof, while the other 40 percent went for the RF.
No matter which configuration, each car is finished in a special Racing Orange color that recalls the original MX-5 Miata Club Racer. Completing the look are 17-inch forged wheels from Rays, Brembo brakes, and 30th Anniversary Edition badging. The interior earns heated Recaro seats, orange stitching and piping, and a Bose 9-speaker audio system.

Each car is also powered by the standard 2.0-liter inline-4 engine, which received a bump to 181 horsepower for 2019. A manual and automatic transmission are offered, but those who choose the stick will also receive special Bilstein dampers.
Customers on the waitlist who've crossed their fingers will be notified in the near future about the newly available cars.

"Well, let me tell you….

Following the recent Chini ya Maji post I thought it would make sense to shed some light on what some of these intrepid “deep sea” entrepreneurs are working on. So strap on!

The Real Tenderpreneurs

There is this team that is quietly and elegantly solving corruption. They are building a tender publishing and procurement management system. Procurement is clearly a massive horizontal market in an important operational segment for companies of all sizes across the continent. Any well ran company of meaningful size has procurement as one of their internal functions.

Particularly in light of the recent anti corruption crackdown procurement is an area crying out for innovative solutions that increase transparency, visibility, and control for organizational leaders. The heartwarming part is how these guys have gone about tackling the opportunity.

First, they established a tender publishers subscription business which provides a steady revenue stream allowing them to turn their focus towards the more complex aspects of developing a platform to solve the workflow, collaboration, and reporting associated with internal procurement practices. They have already completed version 1.0 of the platform and are taking sales meetings.

By virtue of Impact Africa Network’s ecosystem catalytic accelerator I have had the privilege of working with this team helping them apply a strategic lens to their business; interrogate their business model, define a focus, and develop clarity around a go-to-market strategy. Fifteen years selling software helps a ton with this type of stuff.

I am excited about what this team can accomplish. They have a genuine opportunity to build a massive company attacking a ubiquitous, pernicious problem that is a massive drain on African economies. If they are successful tendering and procurement could receive a massive transparency boost the positive effects of which would reverberate across economies. This is an example of a technology solution tackling a massive structural problem. Love!

These guys are smart, gritty, high energy, and eager to learn. I can’t wait for our next strategy session with them. Get em boys!

Mr. Akili Mingi

There is the gentleman I affectionately nick named Akili Mingi (I tend to do that). Dude has been in the tech game since IBM main frames days, and, by his own admission is getting tired and wants an exit strategy. Akili has been at the helm of his startup for over 7 years. His company was referred to me by a repeat customer who, having taken a role at a new company had made it part of her condition of employment that the company replace the existing HR solution with Akilis platform. Customer loyalty is the most reliable sign of awesomeness.

When Akili and I sat down for the first time to dialogue about potential growth capital he confessed right away that he needed a new approach to running the company. The bear-hug-bootstrap model was becoming increasingly unsustainable and at the same time offered no clear exit path.

As a company they have done quite well in my view. They have close to 80 customers across the region, including Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, and just last week he was in Addis completing a deployment at the oldest winery in Ethiopia. Did you know they do wineries up there? I didn’t. How did he get into this deal? A South African ERP company had recommended him. Apparently, the winery is undergoing a full scale tech modernization project. Mark my words friends, this is that canary in a coal mine portending a continent wide tech adoption cycle by businesses over the next 10 years which will drive massive opportunity for startups that are prepared.

Historically, Akili and co. had won a couple of key Enterprise deals against a big UK based competitor that has an aggressive local sales operations going after the HR software market. By all accounts this English company appears to be the big gorilla in that space. But Akili had nary an insight into why or how they had won those deals. Maybe its because during the meeting he had proceeded to showcase at least two other products/startups he was pursuing, one was a school management system, another a payments solution chasing the revenue collection opportunity associated with devolution. Homie has side hustles on his side hustles.

With such frame of mind market data and related insights are not something one traffics much in. You chase opportunity as it presents itself and the only data of note is sale or no sale. Unfortunately, without the insights that come from evaluating ones operational data it is impossible to understand your business let alone craft a reliable plan for growth. But goodness me does this business have potential!

Another impressive thing about Akili is his level of self awareness. It is off the charts. He readily acknowledges both his and his company’s weaknesses. I enjoy sending him meaningful startup related educational content which he gobbles up and appreciates. I do this with all the founders I am in contact with which is a growing list of 30+. I believe part of an investors job is to curate knowledge, information, and contacts for busy entrepreneurs.

One idea Akili and I are considering is to acquire a majority stake in the company, bring on a whip smart young team, empowering him to take a higher level role such as chairman to offer guidance to the new team. There is a great deal of local talent hungry to be immersed in exciting projects related to building the new African economy. Akili’s company could very well be one of them. It would provide a win-win-win outcome across the board.

"Folklore- Taylor Swift Album Review

The pop superstar pivots once more to the most quiet and intimate release of her long career, for what is ultimately a mixed bag.

In 2020, the concert halls, clubs, and stadiums that are usually filled with screaming fans and touring artists sit empty, collecting dust. But the pause on tradition hasn’t stopped some of the biggest artists in music from releasing original material. Now it seems that the isolation of our new abnormal has inspired the biggest pop star on the planet to pivot entirely once again, in a poetic reversal, from pop star to indie singer-songwriter. Folklore marks Taylor Swift’s eighth studio album to date and and an all new direction for her as an artist. The understated rollout fits nicely beside her quietest and most intimate musical release in years, maybe ever.

The title, folklore, and the coppiced album cover had me excited to hear what looked to be a true blue indie record. For the most part that is exactly what Taylor has delivered on folklore, and I do feel that her change in artistic direction is for the best. I have always held the opinion that while she is a gifted songwriter, her pop sensibilities don’t measure up to her contemporaries. Even the best T-Swift pop record can’t compete with the likes of Carly Rae Jepsen, Charli XCX, or a whole crop of newcomers like Rina Sawayama or Dua Lipa. So now having departed from her traditional sound once more I do think I can say that folklore, while not without its faults, is Taylor Swift’s best album in years.

The album starts off very solidly with “the 1” and into the lone single for this album “cardigan,” a song that gives off strong Lana Del Ray vibes but is still a great track nonetheless. Taylor makes it clear right from the opening notes “the 1” what this album is going to sound like. The song that follows, “the last great american dynasty” is without a doubt my least favorite of the entire album, but it is an oddity in the first half of folklore. On “dynasty” Taylor’s love for fictional poetry becomes too impersonal for its own good, to the point that I’m disinterested in the story. From this point on though the album is focused and tight, delivering the best stretch of songs in the whole tracklist. “Exile” with Bon Iver aka Justin Vernon sees the indie legend switching lanes himself into his richer, deeper delivery that we rarely get to see. It’s nice to hear Vernon in this style and the two show impressive chemistry towards the back end of the song. Track five on every Taylor Swift album is traditionally saved for the saddest or heaviest song of the bunch. So on an album like folklore its no surprise that “my tears ricochet” packs a particularly powerful punch. Several more solid songs follow, “mirrorball,” “seven,” and “august,” but after those the cracks begin to show.

What once was fresh on the first half of folklore becomes tired and repetitive on the second half. The instrumentals all follow very similar progressions and while the lyricism is still solid there are no great or sticky melodies that carry with the listener. If you asked me to right now, I don’t think I could sing back even one melody from this entire album that I have listened to five times. The closest we get to a catchy melody is the chorus of “cardigan,” or parts of “invisible string.” It is worth saying that you don’t have to have catchy songs for an album to be good, some of my favorite music especially in the indie scene is devoid of traditional melodies. But Taylor’s lyrics and vocals, while not bad, are not mind-blowing enough to carry the more lackluster parts of the album.

Many have pointed out the obvious issue with the production on folklore is the way Taylor’s vocals are mixed on nearly every song here. They erupt off the track, often dominating the instruemtnal entirely. It is the way vocals should be mixed on a pop record, not on an indie singer-songwriter album. A more hushed vocal style or different production choice would have done many of these tracks a favor.

Across the music community a comparison that many, including myself, have drawn to folklore is Phoebe Bridger’s newest album Punisher. A comparison that is quite honestly unfair to Phoebe Bridgers. If anything Punisher is what Taylor’s album should sound like not what it does sound like. Punisher is varied instrumentally and lyrically with several ear grabbing moments and a cathartic closing track. While Folklore is more like wallpaper indie music with much simpler instrumentals and vocal performances.

In general on this album the songs are well made in a simple but effective style. There are no instrumentals or vocal deliveries that immediately jump out at you, and this allows Taylor’s lyrics to assume center stage, lyrics that are some of her best in nearly a decade. The issue arises when the instrumentals start to become repetitive and the vocal production issues become more obvious.

Folklore represents a seismic shift not only for Taylor Swift as an artist but for the entire indie genre. Indie folk was once style of music so underground the man who pioneered it died penniless. Now that same genre has been cosigned by the biggest pop star on the planet. So while Taylor Swift’s attempt at this once esoteric genre may not be the best or most inventive, it is for many people, the most accessible.

"For many, the notion of divine intervention is an old bearded white male God sitting on a throne up in the heavens who points his hand down to the Earth plane to change the course of human events. When things on the planet seem especially dreadful people will pray to this God asking him to intervene and make things better.

Is this the only place where divine intervention comes from? Or is there another source?

Large groups of people praying can be very, very powerful. But can their praying be re-directed and used more efficiently?

Is divine intervention an energy outside of us? Or is it a power that each human being has? After all, we are all divine beings. We are all Gods in the making. We are all on a long, long journey of becoming aware of and stepping into our divinity. Is part of that journey learning how to use our divine abilities?

Is it up to humans to carry out divine intervention? If so, then how do we do it? How do we use divine intervention to heal the planet? How do we use it to stop war and terrorism? How do we use it to change the course of human events?

We are divine human beings. We are gods. We create our own reality. And we do this through perception. What we perceive is our reality. Divine intervention is when a divine human being perceives their reality as being perfect. When that perception is held and maintained and fed with feeling tone vibrations of love and joy, then it solidifies into our reality. The longer and deeper a perception is held, the more solid it becomes.

Divine intervention on a planetary scale is when a critical mass of humans is perceiving their realities as perfect. This will change, or intervene in, the field of possibilities created by repeated less than perfect perceptions held en masse. This is real divine intervention. It does not come out of the sky but rather from within us; from within us humans. Divine intervention is up to us humans.

And the only way to carry out divine intervention is to see the world as perfect and to hold it in that perfection. To be able to see the beauty in all things and to feel the love and joy in all things, one becomes filled to the brim with appreciation and gratefulness. This appreciation and gratefulness then feeds the perceptions of perfection and the reality we are in continues to solidify and reflect that. Then our every action becomes an act of divine intervention. With our very perceptions we can change the course of human events. With our own divine powers we can create a whole new dimension of reality. It is wholly up to us and how we choose to perceive the world.

Have you ever tried divine intervention? Anyone can do it. Small children are very adept at it. It is not tricky or technical. It merely takes a little practice.

Clear your mind of all thoughts. Empty yourself completely. Release all emotions and all mental chit-chat. Get nice and clear and empty and then see the world as perfect. See the world without conflict or disaster or struggle. See the world existing in perfect harmony. Feel all the love and joy and beauty. See and feel the world as perfect and hold it for as long as you can. Do this 3 to 22 times a day; more if you can. If you do this every single day for one lunar cycle, your reality will change, guaranteed. If enough of us do it together for a week we can affect global events.

Of course, perception is only the first step in the divine intervention process. Once we get good at maintaining positive perceptions we will find ourselves drawn to action that affirms those perceptions. Did you know that every single solitary random act of kindness, no matter how small, is an act of divine intervention? It is divine beings intervening with love in the lives of other divine beings. We have the power to answer other people’s prayers by seeing them as divine and acting upon that in whatever way we can.

Each and every one of us is a very powerful divine being. Our divine powers of perception and action are very powerful. We are learning how to use them. It is not exactly easy but we are slowly getting there. Eventually we will be able to provide the divine intervention needed to realize the paradise of a world that we dream of and pray for.",human,human-written
"The essence of blockchain technology is a set of processes that cannot be manipulated, so transparency is the main feature that forms a solid Foundation of blockchain technology. The financial sector, on the other hand, is becoming a solution for the case of data manipulation, and therefore new innovations have been introduced in the blockchain space, i.e. decentralized Finance, where people can perform financial transactions using decentralized blockchain technology. Smarts Finance is a new ecosystem that represents a new DeFi system for everyone.

About Decentralization:

In their vision of the future, people’s desire to have a say over governance continues to grow by the day. Since Central institutions or structures live a life entirely dependent on the decisions of the Manager or decision-making mechanism at the center, this also causes some problems. Decentralization refers precisely to the fact that power is taken from the center and distributed to all members of the community. It represents a real democracy, not a representative democracy.

The concept of decentralized Finance is an innovative approach that has been put forward to liberate financial institutions. Central financial institutions have spinning wheels on the interests of managers who are always at the center. It is free from problems caused by errors of administrators or structures in the center. If we give an example for the crypto world, you can hear the screams of thousands of victims who have been injured by Central agencies in the past. Many fraud attempts that caused investors to lose their money, and investments lost due to mismanagement, made the community poor, while the Central mechanisms were rich.

Decentralized Finance, on the other hand, eliminates the centralized structure that causes these problems by transferring all management processes to the community. Smarts Finance and similar smart contracts running on the Ethereum network provide the infrastructure for these systems to work.

About the Smarts Finance project:

Smarts Finance promises to provide users with a variety of features provided by modern financial institutions, decentralized. It allows communities to interact directly with each other using methods such as borrowing, lending, or making passive profits without any intermediaries between them.decomposition allows communities to interact directly with each other. You can make transactions directly through smart contracts on the ethereum network without the need for a Bank or financial institution.

Smarts Finance has many competitors in this area, but they want to expand the scope of the platform, offering various advantages over competitors. It eliminates the dividends of Central financial systems by offering better rates both from the point of view of those who want to borrow money and from the point of view of those who want to borrow money, and completely deconstructs these dividends between users.

By doing all this, they also don’t neglect to encourage their community to use the platform with various rewards. They offer privileges to the community that are likely to stand out compared to the competition. They also have various studies and proposals to solve the problem of high gas Fi, one of the biggest problems of decentralized financial platforms.

Areas of use of Smarts Finance:

Liquidity extraction:

One of the most important screws among the principles of operation of decentralized platforms is the extraction of liquidity.deconstruction of liquidity is one of the main areas of work of decentralized platforms. Investors trust between spouses to provide liquidity income by providing them with helps. Your investments that you place in the pool allow people to trade between different divisions, and you receive income from each transaction performed in the ratio of your share in the pool Dec.

Borrowing and lending

The Bank’s dividend is added to the interest rate when you borrow from the Bank. When you perform this transaction with Smarts Finance, more profitable options are formed for both parties, since this transaction will be performed without intermediaries. Central platforms receive various deductions from both the lender and the borrower. Decentralized platforms like SMARTS Finance aim to eliminate these agents. So you can earn income by borrowing your money directly, or you can get the opportunity to borrow money on more favorable terms.

This is a common name for systems that allow you to get a passive return on your investment. You can increase the amount by betting your own platform token, SMAT, USD-based stable coins, or crypto units that you trust in the future. Smarts Finance aims to provide a variety of stake income opportunities.

It has a token structure that allows you to run ERC-20-based smart contracts on the Ethereum network. In addition to being the token Manager of the Smarts Finance decentralized platform, it is a division that can be used to stack or reward users for borrowing and lending activities. His total menstruation is 400,000 SMAT, and 60% of this amount is reserved for betting and other activities on the platform.

Road map:

Conclusion:

Smarts Finance introduces a new DeFi ecosystem, more sophisticated than its predecessors, with more attractive features and benefits. The framework is designed to efficiently execute various processes through their platform and, of course, more efficiently using Blockchain technology. Their own currency token has a healthy tokenomics with an efficient flow allowing for increased demand over time. Basically, the essence of DeFi is a transparent transaction financing process, and so Smarts Finance is one of the recommended DeFi projects that I recommend, so I hope that you will become a part of this wonderful project.

"What Will I Tell You?

As I mentioned in my previous article, visualization is a key point in the data science world. The primary goal of any data science project is to create value. Regardless of the domain, Data Science teams somehow touch the heart of the business and play an important role in every decision that can be made. If you cannot visualize the results of the project in good order, you cannot convey the value of the project in the correct way. Data scientists are responsible for which technologies are installed with which structures in the content of the project. In meetings with one of the stakeholders or other departments, as a data scientist, you need to guide the results of the project rather than the technical details. Insights from the data will help guide the meeting. This article will provide information about how your visualization project should be by using ready-made data sets.

The article was written for visualization projects based on analysis demand rather than the visualization mechanisms of the projects to be sent to production. I will explain the visualizations on the basic chart types without going into too much detail. Producing complex data visuals does not mean creating a good story. Revealing the patterns that need to be explained in your data with as simple plots as possible will contribute to the fluency of the project.

The Common Approach

The essential way is to preserve the codes in the Jupyter notebook, which is data enthusiasts’ main squeeze. It is considered advantageous for Jupyter to be in notebook form and run cell by cell. The codes are all there, and it can be difficult to find the visualizations you will present among the codes you write irregularly. It is often not possible to clean the Jupyter notebook that is being worked on, either because of ‘lack of time’ or for other reasons. It will not be nice during your meeting to any stakeholder or any other department if you present the visualized data from here. The only solution that will make the common approach sustainable is to take the visualizations to be presented from the Jupyter notebook and narrate them through any presentation tool. Actually, this is a work-around procedure that has started your laziness. I only recommend doing this way in case of an emergency. To give an example from real life, there had happened some problems with our map system in my previous company. The problems were related to new business decisions made quickly. Licensed cartographic service was replaced with an open-source routing service called OSRM in a week on the backend side, and it was requested some stats about the comparison of both services. If you are in these conditions and have only a few hours, you can present your results in any presentation tool (or in the same notebook) after you have done your visualizations in Jupyter.

Another important feature that makes the first way fast is that the created visualizations are generally static. The main reason for this situation is that the functions under very easy-to-use packages such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn are preferred when visualizing.

Below I have exemplified some of the chart types drawn in the common method that I have mentioned in general terms. The first two of the plots are static while the last two map visualizations are an interactive Leaflet map. You can access the codes of the interactive ones from the python file called imm_free_wifi_locs in the repo. In the visualizations below, I used a data set from the IMM Data Portal, which I will talk about a lot in the article. The following data set contains the number of newly registered subscriptions in WiFi service that are offered free of charge in some locations of Istanbul.

Change of monthly subscription count on the line graph

Indication of county-based subscription count on the bar graph

In addition to showing IMM’s free wifi locations in point form, they are also presented in hexagonal form with their subscription count in below.

By the way, let’s talk about ‘Datapane’. Datapane is an application programming interface that makes it easy to share results from data with other people after analyzing data. It is the world’s most popular way to share data science insights from Python. You can make great reports and dashboards by making use of this very easy-to-use Python library.

The Holistic Approach

The second way is to do a project design on the codes. I used Jetbrains’ PyCharm product for this. In the designed data visualization study, besides keeping the codes organized, you can provide a better meeting experience by presenting the outputs of the project in your local with different libraries, such as Streamlit. The next step of this systematic approach is to present the results to the relevant teams in real-time with a determined date planning. In this article, I will give information about how the project should be concluded by giving the details of the second way. I will also show some examples of the basic visualization outputs I made on Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IMM) data sets using the ‘plotly’ library.

One of the most significant features that distinguishes the second way from the first is that the visualizations are usually dynamic and interactive. You can play with the plots or save the plots as images by using the toolbar that automatically appears in the plots generated as a result of the code.

Plotly Toolbar

IMM Open Data Portal

The positive change that started in the administration of Istanbul two years ago caused an increase in the quality of service offered to the people of the city. Within the framework of transparent steps in the right direction, it was decided that Istanbul, one of the most beautiful cities in the world, should have an open data platform. IMM Open Data, published in January 2020, is providing access to data provided by IMM and its subsidiary companies. The data is free to access regardless of your intent. There are 171 data sets under 10 different categories. The number of data sets in the portal is increasing day by day. At the same time, you can make a data set request according to your field of study, interest, or any need. IMM Open Data Portal is a good resource for anyone interested in data visualization. I suggest you do data visualization works by choosing some data sets from the portal.

In the article, I used various datasets from governance, people, environment, and mobility. You can see how many data sets there are under the categories from the image below.

Lux

Before the graphics, I want to talk about Lux. Lux is an application programming interface (API) where you can examine general visualizations on any data with a single line of code, and a Python library that simplifies the preliminary steps of data science by automating the data exploration process. Just import the library before you start your work. Using the visualizations created by Lux, you can create an overall picture of your data sets, plan your preprocessing steps on your data and share them with other people by saving the visualizations as ‘html’. For detailed information about Lux-API, you can check Ismael Araujo’s article.

"In 1970 Lewis Powell, who would soon be appointed to the Supreme Court by Richard Nixon, wrote an insightful and prescient memo about what was needed to save capitalism. There were more than 1700 bombings of businesses in 1970 and Powell and his colleagues had every reason to be concerned about the threat to their interests. Powell’s memo has been widely credited with prompting the efforts of the business community to assert their influence. He described the many ways that business could be promoted such as by creating a class of scholars and pundits who could influence public opinion and by efforts to gain political control. He warned that it would require effort “over an indefinite period of years.”

Over the past fifty years, wealthy conservatives have followed Powell’s advice. The result has been the deeply divided country we now live in.

As I predict in my new book, Rebooting Capitalism: How We Can Forge a Society That Works for Everyone, the problems we face will not be eliminated through one or two victorious elections cycles. Our differences are too deeply rooted to think that we can simply eliminate them through even the most sophisticated electioneering techniques.

Many of our problems are unintended consequences of the extensive, well-funded, and largely unnoticed efforts by wealthy conservatives to advance their interests. Their goal was to increase their political power by promoting free market ideology as the way to advance freedom and prosperity. An increasing proportion of our intellectual and political leadership became convinced that government regulation was harmful and that the unfettered pursuit of profits would benefit not only the business community, but the society as a whole. There were so successful that by the 1990s a democratic president could proclaim that the era of big government was over.

Many are inclined to vilify the architects of conservative hegemony. However, in this case — and I believe in every other instance of harm that has been created — a more effective way of thinking about it is in terms of the selection of behavior and practices by their consequences. The network of conservative interests did not set out to increase the oppression of black people, or the proliferation of guns, or the often violent efforts to restrict abortions. They simply set out to win elections because doing so benefited them financially. However, to do so it worked to create a war on drugs in black neighborhoods, to cultivate and align with the evangelical movement and the gun rights movement, and to use dog whistle racism to garner support of the white working class.

Jane Mayer has documented the extensive network of organizations that it has taken to achieve conservative political power. A coalition of conservative billionaires nurtured the careers of thousands of conservative intellectuals, pundits, and career politicians. They realized that to gain political power at the federal level they would need to take control of state governments so that they could gerrymander districts both for state legislators and Congressional candidates. They also realized that they needed to take control of the judiciary, which they have succeeded in doing.

Democratic Party leaders failed to see the deeply rooted system that conservatives were creating. They continued to compete at the level of winning the next election. They lacked a coherent analysis of how society works and what conditions are needed to ensure people’s well-being. Indeed, to a great extent they bought into the free market doctrine. As a result, they did not address the needs and interests of working class Americans.

In Rebooting Capitalism: How We Can Forge a Society That Works for Everyone, I lay out the reforms that are needed in every sector of society. Foundational for this reform is an alternative to free market ideology. That alternative is the scientifically supported understanding of the nurturing conditions that people need in order to thrive. I laid these out in detail in my earlier book The Nurture Effect.

I have created a nonprofit, Values to Action, which organizes study circles — small teams of people who work on a specific aspect of our many problems to produce products that can advance nurturance in society. We are examining the extent to which each sector of society is contributing to the well-being of the entire population. We seek to promote practices that do so, and to eliminate those that harm segments of the population. Here are the areas we plan to address:

· In business we have corporations that market harmful products. In every case we need policies that ensure that corporations lose money as the result of such harmful practices.

· Healthcare is profitable to insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies and many providers, but fails to address the social determinants of ill health. need much greater investment in the prevention of social conditions that lead to ill health and premature death.

· Higher education is investing far more in physical sciences than in the behavioral sciences. We need to train a generation of behavioral scientists and practitioners who can deliver the family school and community programs and policies that have proven benefit in increasing the well-being of the population.

· The harm that the criminal justice system is doing — especially to people of color — is increasingly understood. We need to promote programs and policies that can address these problems.

· We are currently promoting an effort to invest far more in research and practice to reduce concentrated disadvantage in our many high poverty neighborhoods.

· We also need to counter the harmful impact of social media, which has greatly amplified racism, discrimination, and division. Watch Social Dilemma, if you have not yet done so.

· Finally, we are working on climate change. I lead a task force that is working to increase the use of behavioral science research on addressing the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Currently the federal government is funding almost no research on this problem.

· These reforms are foundational for evolving a political system in which it is taken for granted that public policies need to be founded on the goal of ensuring the well-being of every person.

All of these efforts will help to create a society that ensures everyone’s wellbeing. However, progress will be slow if we do not also address the fact that as many as 73 million Americans supported Donald Trump. We need to find ways achieve a rapprochement with this diverse segment of the population. The disappointing election results for down-ticket democrats shows that we will not do this simply through political campaigns.

Study circles focused on this problem will begin by summarizing what behavioral science research shows about social influence and how it can be used to begin to reach reconciliation among the diverse groups that are currently feeling so hostile toward each other.

"When it comes to synchronous motor, it is an AC motor in which the rotation of the shaft is synchronized with the frequency of the supply current at a stable state, the rotation period is exactly equal to an integral number of AC cycles. They are available in self-excited sub-fractional horsepower sizes to high power industrial sizes. In the fractional horsepower range, it is used exact constant speed is needed, for example, analog electric clocks, timers, and other devices where correct time is essential. On the flip side, in the high power industrial sizes, they offer two significant functions such as they convert AC energy to work and function at leading or unity power factor thus delivers power-factor correction.

We have seen that in most of the industries, induction motors are mostly used as it is cost-effective, rugged construction and better starting torques as well as require less maintenance. On the other hand, synchronous motors are infrequently used in industries for drive applications. It is used as a power factor correction device and they help to increase the power factor of the system.

Key features of Synchronous Motors-

They are characteristically not self-starting so they need some outer resources to match the speed of synchronous speed before they are synchronized.

They work as constant speed motors regardless of load condition for constant supply frequency.

It has exclusive characteristics of functioning under any electrical power factor that makes it effective in electrical power factor upgrading.

These synchronous motor are used for various applications. These motors with no load connected to their shaft are utilized for power factor development so they are widely used in the power system in situations where static capacitors are expensive.

You can find then in an application where operating speed is less and high power is required. They are preferably utilized in Reciprocating pumps, compressors, rolling mills, etc.

Key benefits of Synchronous Motors:

There are various benefits of synchronous motor you can get by using it. Some of the most important advantages are discussed below-

They have the ability to control the power factor. An over-excited synchronous motor can have a leading power factor so it can function in parallel to induction motors and other lagging power factor loads. Hence it improves the system power factor.

Regardless of the loads, the speed will remain constant in synchronous motors. It helps in industrial drives where constant speed is needed. They are so useful when it is needed to drive another alternator to supply at a different frequency as in frequency changes.

Synchronous motors can be made with wider air gaps that make them mechanically more stable. In these motors, the electro-magnetic power varies linearly with the voltage.

They typically function with higher efficiencies especially in low speed and unity power factor applications.

You just need to find the best synchronous motor manufacturer and supplier that give you a chance to buy or wholesale bulk synchronous motors at the best pricing range. You can find different companies online easily and compare the price of these motors.",human,human-written

Your Moscow parties —

I’m in real protest in Seattle

Where there are street fights

Every God damn day.

Broken faces.

As boys wild runnin’ in Chechnya.

Everybody is has a ‘round

Of a loaded firearm in their pants.

And they are comparing

With each other

Those fucking fagots

Who’s lady is wearing a better

Lipstick

And who has the longer

Dick.

God damn idiots.

This is America, baby.

Anyone can

Assault you,

Stab you

Hit you in the head

With the brass knuckles

Hit your face,

Or take you out

w/ the 0.40

Caliber

Like in CS: Go.

Oh, no.

Just because

You looked at a wrong

Guy.

Or said something

That he didn’t

Like.

Like the word “Niger”

That you’ve dropped

In the wrong area.

Here is not like in your area

Where you would

Come up with a story

From your area.

Not this

I will correct

Your Ego

And inner spine.

You will be

Quiet.

Watching your mouth

And being careful

If you want your mom

Or your wife

To once again see you

Alive.

Don’t forget —

We live only once.

So don’t waste

Your poor health

To behave like a fagot:

Better take a book in your hands

Or a laptop.

Your gun is already

Taken away,

Discharged,

Bugatti CEO Wolfgang Dürheimer has revealed that the maker of the Veyron and Chiron hypercars is considering a new model line, and there are as many as four possibilities for what it could be.
The information was revealed by Dürheimer during a recent interview with Drive, and though he wasn’t willing to say what the four possibilities were he did say one of them was a sedan along the lines of the Galibier 16C concept unveiled in 2009.
The others are thought to be an SUV, a more accessible supercar, and an electric car of some sort. Crucially, all of them would have higher volumes than the Veyron and Chiron.
Dürheimer said his favorite option is the sedan. Plans for the Galibier were canned while Dürheimer’s predecessor Wolfgang Schreiber was running the show. But with Dürheimer now at the helm there’s a push for a new type of Bugatti, either to be sold alongside the Chiron or after the hypercar’s run.
Dürheimer explained that a new model line was important to shoring up the finances of the brand. Bugatti famously lost money on each Veyron it sold, although that was allowed to pass as the car’s world-beating abilities shone positively on the rest of the Volkswagen Group. But with the tighter scrutiny at the automaker post the diesel emissions cheating scandal, those days are over.
“Part of the decision to keep Bugatti within the portfolio of brands overseen by the Volkswagen Group was tied to assurances that it would provide suitable return on investment within its next phase of operation,” a source told Drive.

"But there were flashing red signs that I either ignored or explained away. He convinced me to drive myself home while I was sustaining a mild panic attack, and his mother didn’t want guests over that night. I made a trip back home for his prom, finding out that he misunderstood when I said I was available to go to the after-party at some beach house. He went without me and sent me photos of him drinking with his friends all night long. There was the date, burned into my memory, where we went to photograph a park and then develop the photos in his makeshift dark room. He hardly said a word the entire 5 hours, and he was surprised when I told him of this. He would vehemently deny I said something I said and only concede if I had written proof, like a time-stamped text message. He convinced me he wasn’t gaslighting.

But at the end of the day, I always returned to the comfort that we loved each other and nothing could ever change that. After all, everyone has their quirks, and I loved him through all of his as he loved me through mine. Even when I finally got the courage to ask him about the future, something that caused him to go silent for days if I brought it up, and he told me he wouldn’t ever be around to see me on a regular basis with his anticipated career, I still held hope. But by then I was outright lying to myself.

Even during the fight where I was at fault for hurting him (I kissed a mutual friend he’d grown to dislike without his explicit consent) he didn’t say a word. It was almost a silent loathing. I didn’t know exactly how he was feeling or why. I tried to apologize from every angle I could think of, and asked what made him feel the way he did. I sincerely wanted to understand, since I personally would not have reacted this way. He didn’t answer and only looked at me with great disappointment that I couldn’t intuit his emotions on my own. He didn’t yell, he didn’t cry. He left me. In silence.

It didn’t help my understanding, however, that any time I asked about our relationship, he’d tell me that he loved me more than anything. That he was so happy to be with me. That even those times when he forgot about our plans, when I drove 30 minutes just to see him for 10, when he didn’t tell me he took a full time internship during the summer I kept open for us, he loved me so much.

Love isn’t everything.

No matter how you feel, a partner needs quality time, effort, respect, compromise, empathy, etc. Love is a feeling; a relationship is a choice. Even friendship is a choice. And everyone has a choice to outwardly treat those they care about with as much love as they hold for them.

He wants to make things right, I know he does. But I don’t think he’s able to be the friend I need him to be… Someone who checks in to see how I’m doing, who doesn’t bail in the middle of a serious conversation, leaving me riddled with anxiety that something terrible happened. Someone who understands that trust can be rebuilt, but it takes time and commitment. Someone who listens to the ways I’ve been hurt and works through the pain right there next to me. I know it can be done because I’ve done it (a story for another time).

If the relationship you’re trying to repair causes you more tears than laughter, it isn’t worth it. You don’t owe them friendship just because you have history. And you can’t move forward by living in the past.

If this person truly wants to be a part of your life, they’ll put in the legwork. By far, the most important part of an apology is asking how/working to make things right. Verbal apologies are only effective if supported by changed behavior. If they aren’t, love yourself enough to not put yourself in that situation again.

2021 is not the year for empty words.",human,human-written
"Trump invited religious persecution survivors to the White House and sat in the middle with his back towards all of them so he could have the best angle for the photographer. He obviously didn’t listen to his staff when they tried to prepare him for who would be there and why because when Iraqi-Yazidi Nobel laureate Nadia Murad told him of the brutal treatment she and her family endured at the hands of ISIS, Trump just sort of sat there like a lump on a porcelain log. She told him that ISIS had killed her mother and 6 brothers. His response? “Where are they now?” Nadia replied, “They killed them. They are in the mass graves in Sinjar.” Trump nodded his head as if to say, “interesting.”

Disinterested. No empathy. No understanding of her extreme pain.

He was only interested in why she got a Nobel Peace Prize. She was captured, tortured and repeatedly raped by ISIS fighters. She lost her entire family to mass genocide and has devoted her life to fighting for others. “Oh really, is that right?’’

Fucking rude idiot.

She pleaded with him to help her people and all he could do was nod like he was listening and look straight ahead. He couldn’t even have a proper face to face meeting with her.

Rude lazy spoiled brat.

Republican hypocrite fun fact: Kevin McCarthy says there weren’t that many people chanting “send her back!” at Trump’s MAGA rally. He said that Trump tried to stop them and that he never mentioned the 4 congresswomen by name which is total documented bullshit but he said it anyway.

Congresswoman Ilhan Omar flew back to Minnesota and was met by constituents at the airport chanting, “Welcome home Ilhan! Welcome home Ilhan!”

The judge who let the teenager off who had raped a girl, filmed it and posted it online because he came from a good family has resigned.

Republicans and the idiots who vote for them don’t know the difference between socialism and communism. They use both words interchangeably as if they mean the same thing to make themselves look as smart as the booby blondes on Fox News.

70 real Christians got arrested at the Capitol. They were there to protest Trump’s treatment of immigrants at the border. Among them were nuns and priests. The evangelicals were outside screaming at immigrants to go back to their countries.

“We have to stop throwing scripture at Republicans when addressing their callousness at the border. They are unmoved by their hypocrisy.” — Bakari Sellers

How many evangelicals would still identify as Christians if they didn’t believe that middle eastern Jesus looked like Brad Pitt?

Martha McSally, the Republican senator in Arizona who was handed the job after she lost the election for the other seat, wouldn’t answer reporters when they asked her about Trump’s mob “send her back” chants. She’s up for re-election in 2020. Send her back home, Arizona.

“The most troubling realization of the last 3 years: It’s not that Trump’s a racist. It’s that nearly half the country loves him BECAUSE he’s a racist.” — Bryan Behar

Things have gotten so bad in Congress that a priest did an exorcism on the House floor and prayed to cast out all spirits of darkness.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel ripped Trump a new one for undermining “America’s strength” after he told 4 Democratic congresswomen of color to “go back” to their home countries. She said she was going to distance herself from him and stand in solidarity with the women who were attacked. That’s a powerful gesture from the leader of the country who gave the world Hitler.

What is the end game for the Republican party? One party rule? Civil War? Take over the world? Or are they just going to roll with whatever Trump does until they roll right off a cliff?

Let it roll.

Could the latest 2014 Lexus IS spawn a new-generation of the SportCross?
According to Lexus it may.
The automaker recently posted an image of the original 2003 IS 300 SportCross on its Facebook page along with the message: “Do you remember the ‘02 IS 300 SportCross with its style, utility and performance? Will we bring it back? Watch the 2014 IS premiere on Facebook in 6 days to find out!”
Though it’s not quite full confirmation of the vehicle, it does strongly suggest that an announcement on a new IS SportCross could be made soon. The IS premiere is currently scheduled for January 15.
The original model, launched between the 2002 and 2005 model years, was never a top seller despite its positive attributes. The car combined stylish good looks with a practical wagon body and rear-wheel-drive dynamics, which at the time should have ticked all the right boxes for enthusiasts, but for some reason it fizzled and sales were eventually discontinued.
A new SportCross based on the latest 2014 Lexus IS is certainly an interesting proposition. Revealed this week ahead of its official debut at the 2013 Detroit Auto Show, the new sedan adopts aggressive looks, a similar powertrain lineup to the outgoing model, and a driver-focused interior inspired by the design from the Lexus LFA supercar.  
We should have more details on both the new IS as well as its possible SportCross spin-off once press days for the Detroit show kick off next Monday. In the meantime, make sure to bookmark our dedicated show page in case if you haven’t already.

"On the surface, the differences might not seem like a big deal, but in fact each legal entity is unique. More importantly, each has varying rights and benefits. Perhaps an example can illustrate. Take a look at Apple, for instance:

“Apple Inc.” is the business entity name. This is what denotes the legal entity, which in this case is a publicly traded U.S. corporation.

“Apple.com” is a domain name, but this denotes only one of the domain names owned by Apple Inc. Others include me.com, icloud.com, itunes.com, iPhone.com, iPad.com — the list goes on.

“Apple” is a registered federal trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The trademark denotes that the source of the goods or services sold in conjunction with the word “Apple” is Apple Inc. — and its subsidiaries. Apple owns many other federal trademarks too, including iPhone, iPad, Mac, etc.

At first glance, a business’ entity name, domain name and trademark seem incredibly similar. All include the name “Apple,” right? But, from a legal standpoint, it’s important to point out that each is different, because the legal rights associated with each are quite different.

Let me explain. . .

Business entity name

A business entity name is generally registered in conjunction with the formation of a separate legal entity at the state level through state governmental authorities, such as the secretary of state, the state’s corporation commission, etc. Common types of business entities include, but are not limited to:

Corporations

Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)

Limited Partnerships

A business entity is a fictional separate legal person and generally enables limited liability protection from the debts of an entity for the owners of a separate legal entity.

For example, if the corporation owes $1 million and doesn’t have the assets to pay that debt, the owners of the corporation — called shareholders — are not personally responsible to pay that debt. This is true only as long as they haven’t personally guaranteed the debt and haven’t engaged in “bad behavior” to otherwise jeopardize that protection.

Although limited liability protection can be very significant, in most states, there aren’t a whole of rights associated with business entity names that enable you to prohibit someone else from using a confusingly similar name to your business entity.

Domain name

A domain name is a series of numbers and/or letters that:

may point to a website;

may point to services such as FTP; or

may be associated with email addresses.

Domain names are typically registered by ICANN-accredited registrars. Because of this centralized registration process, domain names are different from both business names and trademarks because the rightful owner of the domain name can generally prohibit someone else from using it without involving the courts.

Perhaps more surprising, however, is that almost anyone can buy your same domain name with a different top level domain, in many cases. For example, if you own the domain name your-company.com, other people can generally buy your-company.net or your-company.org.

With all of that in mind, consider that the use of a domain name can create common law trademark rights in the domain name. That’s where things get confusing.

Trademarks

In the United States, there are two types of trademarks: state trademarks and federal trademarks.

State Trademarks. State trademarks are valid only in the state or states in which they are used or registered. These are acquired when a business uses a trademark in conjunction with the sale of goods or the provision of services. But here is the surprising part: State trademarks generally don’t need to be registered at the state level before you can use them. Actually, your use of a trademark generally gives you rights in that trademark automatically.

Many states call state trademark registrations “DBAs” or “doing business as.”

Even though state registration is not generally required, there are benefits to state trademark registration. Many times, state trademarks get benefits that are not otherwise granted to trademarks that aren’t registered with the state. Still, these rights vary from state to state.

Unlike a business entity name, the standard used to determine trademark infringement is much more rigorous and involved than the standard used to determine whether a business-entity name infringes upon another business’ entity name. Specifically, courts often look at whether one state trademark is confusingly similar to another and is likely to cause confusion among the buying public.

Federal trademarks. Federal trademarks are generally considered the “holy grail” when it comes to protecting a brand. Valid federal trademarks are automatically valid throughout the entire United States, with some limited exceptions, and don’t require state registration. In addition, the rights afforded to federal trademarks are more significant than the rights associated with state trademarks.

In particular, the owners of federally-registered trademarks are granted the following rights:

The right to use the trademark nationwide

The right to file for an injunction

The right to file for monetary damages

The right to prohibit importation

At first glance, these rights may not seem that significant; however, a further examination shows that they can effectively enable one brand to prohibit any other brands from using a particular trademark throughout the United States and worldwide, according to the Madrid Protocole.

Are you protected?

Although a business’ entity name, domain name and trademark all appear similar on the surface, they’re not. If you’re going to spend a lot of time and money developing your business and brand, it’s critical to understand the distinctions between and among these concepts and the rights associated with them.",human,human-written
"Welcome to our renewable resource page. Here you can learn more about what a renewable resource is and the importance of it.

A renewable resource is a resource which is replaced naturally and can be used again. Examples are: oxygen, fresh water, solar energy, timber, and biomass. Renewable resources may also include goods commodities such as wood, paper and leather.



Types of renewable sources:

Fossil fuels are non-renewable, that is, they draw on finite resources that will eventually dwindle, becoming too expensive or too environmentally damaging to retrieve. In contrast, the many types of renewable energy resources-such as wind and solar energy-are constantly replenished and will never run out.

Renewable sources VS. Non-renewable sources:



Nonrenewable energy resources like coal, nuclear, oil, and natural gas, are available in limited supplies. This is usually due to the long time it takes for them to be replenished. Renewable resources are replenished naturally and over relatively short periods of time.

Why are renewable resources are important?



Renewable energy is important because of the benefits it provides. The key benefits are:

· Environmental.

· Energy for out children’s children’s children.

· Jobs and economy.

· Energy security.

Renewable & Nonrenewable Resources

What are renewable resources?

· A renewable resource is a resource which is replaced naturally and can be used again.

Examples:

· Oxygen, fresh water, solar energy, timber, and biomass.

· Renewable resources may also include goods commodities such as wood, paper and leather.

What are nonrenewable resources?

· A nonrenewable resource is a resource of economic value that cannot be readily replaced by natural means on a level equal to its consumption.

· Does not renew itself at a sufficient rate for sustainable economic extraction in meaningful human time-frames.

Examples:

· Most fossil fuels, such as oil, natural gas and coal — their use is not sustainable because their formation takes billions of years.

Facts: Renewable Resources

1. Water can be considered a renewable material when carefully controlled usage, treatment, and release are followed. If not, it would become a non-renewable resource at that location.

2. Most food has its origin in renewable resources. Food is obtained directly from plants and animals.

3. An important renewable resource is wood provided by means of forestry, which is used for construction, housing and firewood since ancient times.

4. Plants provide the main sources for renewable resources, the main distinction is made between energy crops and Non-food crops.

5. Renewable energy refers to the provision of energy via renewable resources which are naturally replenished fast enough as being used. It includes e.g. sunlight, wind, biomass, rain, tides, waves and geothermal heat. Renewable energy may replace or enhance fossil energy supply various distinct areas: electricity generation, hot water/space heating, motor fuels, and rural (off-grid) energy services.

Facts: Nonrenewable Resources

1.Nonrenewable resources are raw materials, which take long periods of time to form.

2.Resources such as timber (when harvested sustainably) and wind (used to power energy conversion systems) are considered renewable resources, largely because their localized replenishment can occur within time frames meaningful to humans.

3. Natural resources such as coal, petroleum (crude oil) and natural gas take thousands of years to form naturally and cannot be replaced as fast as they are being consumed.

4. Non renewable resources are those natural resources that cannot be reproduced, grown or generated.

The two main type of non renewable resources are fossil fuels and nuclear fuels :

Fossil fuels include coal, petroleum, natural gas — Fossil fuels are formed by the pressure and heat applied to the organic matter, which lies deep down underground or under the ocean bed. These fossil fuels take around millions of years for its formation



Nuclear fuels make use of radioactive elements to release energy. Uranium and plutonium are the two important radioactive elements used to derive nuclear energy, which in turn is used to generate electricity on a large-scale. In fact, nuclear power provides around 14–15% of the world’s electricity",human,human-written
"TACTICS: Intentions, goals, execution!

Today it is essential to stick to your guns. You have been planning; you have been pondering what you do, how you accomplish. You must execute your planning. You need to combine rigorous planning with a ‘hardcore’ execution.

Yesterday, I was talking to the head of sales of EMEA at an enterprise company. Let’s call her Janice. She has been very inspirational, and we touched upon how great it is to plan but even more to execute.

So, what does Janice thing about planning vs. execution? Let me paraphrase it. You can try to plan everything, but it’s instead set up small projects and campaigns and go out to test it. Most likely, you might fail, which will force you to go back and recenter.

“When we accept that doing a thing for the first time might be ugly, we accept the messiness and failure, we don’t have to pretend to be perfect.” — Fit-budd

Intentions and goals

In my opinion, first, you have a thought to do something, and from there, you design your goals and go out and act on your plan.

An intention is an idea that you plan (or intend) to carry out. If you mean something, it’s an intention. Your goal, purpose, or aim is your intention. It’s something you intend to do, whether you pull it off or not.

A goal is an idea of the future or desired result that a person or a group of people envision, plan, and commit to achieving. People endeavor to reach goals within a finite time by setting deadlines.

Let’s say you are having a good intention to understand diet and the relation with your gut, but is that enough? A good intention does not mean you will go and act upon that intention unless you decide to do repeatedly study, read and try until you understand the relation properly.

Action is the fact or process of doing something, typically to achieve an aim.

Here some of the keywords:

Steps, measures, activity, movement, work, working, effort, exertion, operation, act, take steps, take measures, take the initiative, move, make a move, react, do something.

Simplify, simplify, simplify

If you think about your goals like a sequence of milestones and touchpoints, rather than one big piece and chunk, it will be easier for your brain and you to associate with it and execute it.

Human beings need to have a big fat ‘WHY’ if you have not read the book from Simon Sinek, Golden Circle.

You need to follow strong motivation and make sure you measure progress.

“The biggest secret of progress is — consistency.” — Fit-budd

Embrace struggle and perseverance

So, embrace the learning curve, be accountable to your friends and family. Show them you are working towards something bigger and that you need and want to succeed. Don’t take it for granted; we give up way too often and way too soon.

Build your self-esteem around something real, not something fragile, like accepting when you say you’ll do something, and you DON’T DO that!

Be the gal and guy that honors struggle and perseverance. Build your self-esteem around executing your goals. Stick to your guns, proud yourself with going out and trying stuff out even when it’s scary.",human,human-written
"Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a widely-deployed protocol used for securing TCP connections on the Internet. Kernel TLS is one of the Linux kernel features trying to improve TLS record layer functionality by offloading the symmetric encryption step to the Linux Kernel after successful handshaking between the client and server.

This feature is currently available in some encryption libraries (built-in or as a patch) like OpenSSL. In this text, I am trying to categorize some motivation behind this idea and analyze the pros and cons of this mechanism.

Reduce memory copy

Standard web server using OpenSSL (From the Facebook original article)

Kernel level TLS or KTLS is not a new idea, and many companies developed their own kernel-level solutions to address the TLS performance problem. For example, companies like Facebook and Netflix (for BSD) used this method for reducing the overhead of the kernel to user and user to kernel memory copy. For the Facebook version, there was about 7% improvement in the famous “SendFile” function. For Netflix, the story is entirely different, and they claim they can handle approximately 100G of TLS traffic that seems mainly related to efficient usage of hardware accelerators.

KTLS Functionality ( From the Facebook original article)

Regarding the KTLS, when TLS functionality is activated using the SetSocketOption, we can use some high performance and low-level functions like SendFile to copy data directly from the storage and reduce the overhead of memory copy. Some patches for famous networking software (Ngnix, Haproxy) enable this functionality, but it shows a little performance improvement and, in some cases (Haproxy), even performance degradation. So, although too much memory copying (especially between user and kernel) can reduce performance, it is not the main bottleneck of TLS.

Use of hardware accelerators

Modern network interface cards (NIC) support many offloading features, from simple checksum calculation to advance flow management. Nowadays, most of them support some level of encryption and even compression offloading. For example, Intel 82599 series chipset supports AES-128-GMAC offloading. Using these offloading features is the main reason behind the Netflix performance gain. But there are some problems with this approach. Not all the NIC support this feature, and most of them support the limited modes of the AES encryption algorithm. For example, Intel NIC supports AES128 in GMAC and GCM mode. It means, If the client or server chooses any other algorithm, the offloading functionality is useless, so we need to limit the encryption algorithms in the handshake phase.

According to Linux documentation currently, only three symmetric algorithms are supported by the Linux kernel (AES_GCM_128,AES_GCM_256,AES_CCM_128).

KTLS data and context flow

security considerations

As I mentioned in the previous section, we need to limit the available algorithms to utilize maximum performance. Currently, only the AES family of algorithms supported by the kernel, and we need to reduce our symmetric algorithms to this family of encryption algorithms. AES 256 is virtually impenetrable using brute-force methods, and other modes are safe enough to be recommended by NIST, so I don’t think this limitation has a negative security impact.

But there is a significant security concern regarding KTLS architecture. After the handshake, we need to transfer the required information (TLS context) to the kernel. This functionality traditionally implemented using “setsocketopt” API. This function transfers all the information clearly, and it is possible to sniff them using classic kernel-based rootkits or even using Linux’s relatively new EBPF mechanism. In the following link, I developed a POC code and script that demonstrate this technique.

KTLS Stack and the EBPF sniffer

Another security concern is related to the hardware’s actual implementation of encryption algorithms and the storing mechanism of the encryption keys and other sensitive materials. It is also possible to use a fake NIC instead of the original one or replace the NIC standard driver with a fake one.",human,human-written

Audi’s next-generation A4, the B9 series, won’t be in American showrooms until the 2017 model year (yes, the current model has one year left in it), but we’ll see the car unveiled this September at the 2015 Frankfurt Auto Show. We already have a pretty good idea as to what the latest luxury small sedan will look like, however, thanks to numerous sightings of prototypes, the recent leak of a pre-production unit, as well as a spy video showing one of the final prototypes testing at the Nürburgring and on the German race track’s surrounding roads.
The new A4 will be Audi’s second model to ride on the new 'modular longitudinal' MLB Evo platform, which will eventually underpin most of the automaker’s models from the A4 up. Previewed in Audi’s Sport quattro concept, the MLB Evo uses a combination of high-strength steel, aluminum and even some composites to help get weight down. Look for weight savings of around 200 pounds compared to the current A4. The first vehicle to adopt the new platform is the 2017 Q7.
Front-wheel drive will remain standard for the 2017 A4 while quattro all-wheel drive will continue to be offered as an option. We may also see four-wheel steering plus a hybrid-based all-wheel-drive system dubbed “e-quattro”, though Audi is yet to confirm this. The front suspension should be comprised of five links per wheel, while the rear suspension should be based on the self-tracking trapezoidal link principle coveted by the brand with the four rings.
Audi 2.0-liter TFSI with 187 horsepower and 236 pound-feet of torque
Audi recently revealed a new 2.0-liter TFSI for its next-gen A4. The engine, which features a combustion method similar to the Miller cycle, develops 187 horsepower. This is lower than the 220 hp the 2.0-liter mill in the current A4 develops, but the new engine should be more efficient and more tractable.
Those seeking extra efficiency will have two new options: a 2.0-liter diesel and a plug-in hybrid e-tron model.
Sitting above these will be a new S4 model equipped with a supercharged 3.0-liter V-6, possibly with as much as 340 hp on tap. Also in the lineup should be a high-performance RS 4 variant. It’s not clear at this point if the latter will be available in both sedan and wagon forms (the current RS 4 is only available as an Avant wagon) but given the growing popularity of the RS brand in the U.S., it's safe to assume that an RS 4 sedan will be launched this time around.
Look for a debut of the 2017 Audi A4 in the lead up to the Frankfurt Auto Show in September. More practical Avant and Allroad wagon variants should follow roughly one year after the sedan.
Stay tuned for updates as development of the 2017 Audi A4 continues.

December 21, 2020

Ten days away from the end of the year, and the looming date of 1 January, the British government still can’t negotiate a deal with its most important commercial, political and trading partner, the European Union.

As the numbers of Covid cases grow every day in the country, what could bring more panic to British people? Indeed, a few days ago, a new opinion poll showed that two-thirds of Brits want the government to reach a trade deal with the EU.

This poll was conducted by YouGov on behalf of the group known as Best for Britain, which has done remarkable work to inform British people on the consequences of Brexit since 2016. The poll interrogated 1,703 people between 10 and 11 December 2020.

The results show that the country overwhelmingly supports ending the Brexit transition period with a trade deal. We now have less than two weeks to do so. 66% of those polled supported leaving with a deal, compared to just 15% who said they would prefer a no-deal outcome. The poll found that even Conservative voters prefer a trade deal to a no-deal outcome by a ratio of 2 to 1.

This also clearly shows that every region in the UK came out in favour of a EU trade deal by the end of this year. London and the North of England were the regions with the highest levels of support for a deal, at 73% and 68% respectively, followed by Scotland and the rest of the South of England.

With just a few days to go before the end of the transition period, Best for Britain CEO Naomi Smith said the findings show that:

“The Prime Minister has no mandate for a no-deal Brexit. A year ago he won the election on a promise of delivering an ‘oven-ready’ trade agreement with the EU. He told voters the chance of no-deal was ‘a million to one’. Failing to deliver on those promises just a year down the line, while the country is in the middle of the most painful economic recession in recent memory, would be a betrayal of all those voters who supported the Prime Minister at the last election and, in his own words, a failure of statesmanship.”

Best for Britain is a non-partisan group campaigning for a UK-EU trade deal. I have had the pleasure to meet their CEO Naomi Smith while invited on a couple of episode of a podcast about Brexit issues. These podcasts were called “Remaniacs” but are now “ Oh God What Now”. I’ve followed Naomi’s amazing work since and Best for Britain is one of the organisations we can trust the most on this issue.

With the passage of the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020, Best for Britain believe the UK must now focus on securing the trade deal promised in the Conservative Party manifesto, delivering for business and communities across the country. In the context of the coronavirus pandemic, they also worry about the impact of leaving the Single Market and Customs Union when the transition period ends on 31st December 2020.

I personally believe Brexit should be “frozen” until the pandemic is over. No one, even the most determined supporters of Brexit, voted for such suffering and uncertainty.

Last week, the EU announced that British citizens would not be allowed to travel to the EU member-states after 1 January as long as the threat of the pandemic is ongoing. Since Saturday (19 December), the traffic between Calais and Dover has become extremely difficult. This Sunday (20 December), the Netherlands announced they are banning British citizens from entering their country with immediate effect.

Here in Bristol, where the Europhile sentiment is quite high and the organisation “The 3 Million” was founded to support the Euro-citizens, I see many people expressing their anxiety on social media on a daily basis.

If Boris Johnson’s government ends up not signing a deal in the coming days, the British public now knows he is able to deliberately go against their will.",human,human-written
"12:44pm. A time that is permanently singed into my memory. A stinging pain that overcomes me every time I see it on the clock. A burning scar. My heart skips a beat. A physical ache. A moment of breathlessness. I still hear the nurse’s voice so clearly in my head. “Time of death, 12:44pm.”

It’s been 244 days since I lost her. 244 days since a piece of me left with her. My little sister. My baby sister. I knew it would come, but I wasn’t ready. I know now that I never could have been ready. Never could have been fully prepared for the anguish that comes with loss. The deep physical pain I feel when I remember that she’s really gone. I’ve never felt so wounded. And yet, I’m still standing. How is that possible?

Having a sister with a terminal illness has always been mentally challenging for me. Throughout my life, any time I told someone that my sister had cystic fibrosis, the response was always “I’m so sorry”. I never understood that. Of course, I appreciated the words. But I was never able to fully process that terminal meant death. An unavoidable fate. An inevitable conclusion.

To me, Claire was infinite.

There was nothing that could stop her. I saw her distress and suffering and pain first hand. And it was torturous. But she always pulled through. She always fought like hell. She’s cheated death before. She’ll cheat death again. I could never consider the alternative. My mind wouldn’t allow me to. We’re so close to a cure. One day she’d be freed from the grips of this disease. I couldn’t call it hope, because I knew it. I was sure of it. Until I wasn’t.

They say that grief comes in waves, and I’ve always wondered what that meant. Now I know. And there is no better way to describe it.

At first, you’re lost in a fog. A haze of denial. Like you’re trapped inside of a lucid dream. And all the while, you feel the wave brewing. Little stings of pain churning in your heart. Little moments where you’re able to touch reality, but only for a second. Your body won’t allow you to. Your mind won’t allow you to.

You cling to photos, videos and songs — things that keep her alive. You’re able to block out the world and the future. You’re able to just be — in that moment with her. Like nothing else exists. But the wave is still brewing, even faster than before.

Then, the tidal wave comes. It’s so unexpected. It crashes around you, and you’re unsure if you’ll make it out alive. Drowning in the weight of reality. I never expected the physical pain. The deepest feeling of sorrow, like you got the wind knocked out of you. You can’t catch your breath. Every memory and every word and every reminder comes flooding around you. And all you can do is try your best to survive the shipwreck. All you can do is float.

In the beginning, the waves crash hard and without mercy. I wondered if I’d ever be myself again. I couldn’t talk to people. I couldn’t get out of bed. I questioned my faith. How could God do this to us? To her? A 24-year battle to breathe, to live. For what? Why her? She was too good for this. She didn’t deserve this. This unavoidable fate. This inevitable conclusion.

I was so angry. All of the wasted suffering. I dreaded the future. All of the moments that should be so sweet — family vacations, getting married, having kids. It all seemed so bitter. I never pictured myself being truly happy again. A constant stream of waves crashing into me. I couldn’t catch my breath.

But somehow, as time moves on, the waves become less frequent. They still come, but come further apart. You can function. You can breathe. In some moments I wondered if it was possible to keep going. But you just do. You just keep floating. And that’s what she would want.

I still see her in my dreams. It’s always the same scenario. She and I sitting, just talking. It’s not a moment from the past but a moment from the present. A few months after she passed away, I dreamed that we were hugging. The dream lasted a while, and all we did was hug. I cried into her shoulder. But she wasn’t crying. She was comforting me, saying that “everything is going to be ok.” Just like what she would do if she were here. Always reassuring me that no matter the circumstance, I was going to be ok. It was so real. My mom, dad, brother and countless friends of hers have had the same dream. The same scenario. They are sitting down, in the present, just talking.

Last week in a dream, I told her that I missed her. She responded, “I miss you, too. But we can talk to each other like this.” I woke up, tears streaming down my face. I no longer question my faith. I no longer question where she is. I just know.

Moments like this trigger the waves. But I’m thankful for them. Moments like this serve as a reminder for me.

Claire is infinite.

And she always will be. I know the waves will never stop coming, and, somehow, I don’t want them to. Because it keeps our love alive. Other waves will come, and I’ll survive them, too. And if I’m lucky, I’ll have lots of scars from lots of love. And lots of shipwrecks.",human,human-written

After its domination of Pikes Peak last year, Peugeot is set to return to another arena in which it once competed--the famed Dakar rally. The Pikes Peak partnership of Peugeot Sport, Red Bull and Total will join forces once again for the 2015 Dakar rally, hoping to replicate Peugeot's late 1980s run of four victories in 205 T16 and 405 TSI Grand Raid vehicles. The team dominated the sport from 1987 to 1990, at the hands of world-class drivers like Ari Vatanen, Juha Kankkunen and Jacky Ickx.
Despite a crash early on in the 1987 rally, Vatanen recovered from 274th place to take the top spot after over 8,000 miles of competition. Kankkunen won the second year in his 205 T16, after Vatanen's 405 T16 was stolen during an overnight halt. Vatanen claimed the 405's first victory the next year (despite rolling twice), and in 1990 he dominated in the same car--a vehicle now cemented into the minds of rally and off-road fans everywhere.
Following Peugeot's Pikes Peak success in the 208 subcompact, Peugeot has chosen the 208-based 2008 crossover for its 2015 attempt. Like the old 205 and 405, the 2008 is a key model for Peugeot--it's selling strongly in Europe and soon to go on sale in China and Latin America, too--and its pseudo off-road image makes the car a natural fit for the grueling Dakar. The 208's Pikes Peak record also spurred the decision to compete in the first place--Peugeot neatly describes Sebastien Loeb's record as ""giving them wings"" as far as further competition is concerned.
With Loeb himself busy in the World Touring Car Championship, Peugeot has recruited World Rally Champion and 2010 Dakar winner Carlos Sainz and Dakar motorcycle expert Cyril Despres to lead its team. With two top drivers, Pikes Peak momentum and plenty of technical expertise behind it, only a fool would rule out Peugeot as a front-runner in the 2015 Dakar rally. The team will have strong competition though--since Volkswagen pulled out of the sport a few years ago, the 2008's MINI Countryman rival has dominated the off-road discipline. 2015 will be one to watch...

"Homeless student-athletes will be coached to improve academic, social and basketball skills

President and CEO Kirk Ray Smith of Hope Villages of America, formerly RCS Pinellas, announced today an exciting new partnership with The Basketball Warehouse that will benefit the school-aged kids staying at Grace House and Goldsmith Gardens.

“Without question, Smith said, “there is a correlation between social challenges and academic performance. It’s also true that athletics are an excellent tool for the development of life and social skills. This partnership allows us to develop young people and provide a much-needed distraction from the challenges they’re facing.”

Each year Hope Villages (HVA) staff and volunteers serve individuals and families with care and compassion. “We help those in need who are the most vulnerable among us get back onto a path of self-sufficiency with dignity,” said Smith of their work with more than 130,000 participants — or about 15 percent of the Pinellas County population. Homeless families are one of the fastest-growing demographics they serve. “There are only 180 beds for homeless families in Pinellas County, which has a population of almost 1 million people. HVA provides nearly half of those beds, and Grace House provides dignified apartment-style emergency shelter to homeless families with children for up to two months,” Smith reported.

Grace House staff work one-on-one with families, providing case management, education, job readiness and helping guests save money to secure stable housing. “We are proud to report that fully 90 percent of families who complete the program move to stable housing.”

Goldsmith Gardens provides affordable housing for families, who sign a one-year lease as they transition to stable housing.

HVA focuses on nurturing and developing the children in their programs as well as supporting their parents in finding employment and secure housing to return to self-sufficiency. “Academic and athletic development opportunities for kids are just one of the diverse wraparound services we provide at HVA to help interrupt the cycle of poverty,” said Smith. “We support not only the whole person but the whole family to reach self-sufficiency.”

The Basketball Warehouse’s mission to provide student-athletes a safe, nurturing after-school environment that fosters individuality, a love for basketball and a delight in learning dovetails perfectly with HVA’s approach. The Basketball Warehouse will offer on-site academic support, enrichment opportunities, and health/fitness activities through basketball clinics to the Grace House and Goldsmith Gardens student-athletes through this new partnership.

The Basketball Warehouse’s Coach Allen Williams said, “Our motto at the Warehouse has always been ‘do what you do.’ Which basically means be the best version of yourself and do what you do best. We want to give these kids the opportunity to do what they do and be the best they can be.”

“The environment at The Basketball Warehouse is one of diversity, integrating student-athletes from different schools, neighborhoods, economic and cultural backgrounds, encouraging them to work together in team activities and tutoring sessions to become better prepared for society,” explained Smith. “Their programs are fun for our kids and also keep them safe and help them achieve success in school and life.”

"“There is a crack in everything hat’s how the light gets in.” — Leonard Cohen

Maybe you are a bit too sensitive.

You feel things like negative emotions on a deeper level than others seem to.

And you’ve been burnt badly for sharing those feelings.

So you learned to hide from the world. Instead of taking a risk on being vulnerable, you retreat into the safety of stuffing negative emotions.

But the hurt’s still there…you try to let it go, yet the old wounds fester.

No surprise, really, the way painful events constantly replay in your mind. And you’re always reliving wretched feelings like abandonment, betrayal, and rejection.

Much as you try to control them, they seem to have a life of their own.

But you know, it’s not actually the feelings that cause your grief.

How you react to negative emotion is the real problem — and that’s a good thing. Because changing your reactions makes it easier to control runaway emotions.

By doing a little advance work before you’re triggered, you can handle stressful events with poise.

And with new responses, you’ll find that many of your problem emotions dissolve on their own!

1. Stop running and start dealing

“Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror. Just keep going. No feeling is final.” – Rainer Maria Rilke

From an early age, we are conditioned to avoid painful feelings. And because we’re not trained to deal with them, we resort to suppressing them, brooding, or distracting from them. This creates enormous internal conflict and we flounder in a state of perpetual struggle.

We’re constantly fighting feelings we’re not “supposed” to have — which leads to the idea that we’re what’s flawed. So, we stuff those feelings too, creating even more conflict and reinforcing our identity as inadequate.

It’s contrary to every survival instinct, but to rise above negative emotions, you first have to stop fighting them. The fight, our denial, is what prevents us from moving on. To be free of toxic emotions is to stop running and start dealing with them.

When they arise, use practices like breathwork or mindfulness to stay present. Only then can you face your fears and exercise the power of choice to build a future free of pain, shame, and conflict.

2. Look for the lessons in your discomfort

“Close some doors today. Not because of pride, incapacity or arrogance, but simply because they lead you nowhere.” — Paulo Coelho

The practice of staying present starts a stage of discomfort. All the emotions we’ve suppressed as “bad” are still waiting to be heard and addressed. Lucky for us because they contain vital lessons for our happiness and well being.

Here’s the thing — the discomfort is never as severe as we imagine. And once you’re willing to feel the full range of everything you’ve stuffed — the failure, rejection, shame, and so on — you can take on any situation with confidence.

Whatever changes are required, you can be sure that the only loss you’ll endure are those aspects of yourself that cause disappointment, self-loathing, and suffering.

Instead of suffering in vain, mine your discomfort. It holds a wealth of information about the inaccurate beliefs, biases, and rules that hold you back. What are they telling you? What do you need to let go of, or do more of? Where do you need to accept responsibility, what are you avoiding?

3. Plot a new course

“You can’t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending.” — C. S. Lewis

Managing emotional turbulence is a skill that pays huge dividends. This is because our emotions lead to the actions that we will or won’t take, which creates our life experiences now and in the future.

With years of repetition, we hard-wire negativity into our neural circuits, which informs us about what to feel and how to behave. If our emotional life doesn’t change, today will be the same as yesterday. And tomorrow will be the same as today.

To create a new tomorrow, without yesterday’s sad, repetitive crap, we need new responses to emotional triggers — ones that makes us feel better, not worse. This means thinking differently, changing your perspective, and planning for better results.

Brainstorm with a journal or mind map to envision a future self that has gone far beyond emotionally toxicity. On paper, create your ideal self, one that’s emotionally strong, sure, and confident. Then outline your plan to become that person — starting today.

4. Act on your decision

“Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy.” ―Dale Carnegie

Once you’re clear on your path, act on it. Announce your intentions, chunk your plan down into actionable steps, set a schedule, and start to work on it. Knowing in advance how you intend to respond to stress before it happens prevents slipping into old patterns.

Get crystal clear on why you want to change, how you’re going to do it, and the tools you’ll use to assist you. Your vision needs support, so strive to act consistently and reinforce it daily.

Journal about it, visualize, talk to friends about it, and importantly, feel the emotions of having accomplished your goal. And be sure to incorporate new responses to old triggers, ones you can use in the moment as well as long-term solutions.

For example, creating distance from your emotions with breathwork is something that can be done in the moment. Exercises like meditation or yoga aren’t practical in the moment, but their effectiveness at reducing stress and improving emotional regulation is beneficial in the long run.

5. Release the past

“It’s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.” — Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland

For your emotional, mental, and physical well-being, it’s important to release toxic emotions promptly when they arise. Not only will you feel better, letting go also develops emotional resilience and the ability to see events in a new, positive light.

It’s helpful to first identify and own the emotions with “I” language, such as “I’m feeling scared.” This acknowledges what you’re feeling and puts you in control of the situation, not external events or other people.

For many, intense physical activity such as dancing, martial arts, or running works best. Others find relief in calming practices such as breathwork, chanting, EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique), journaling, massage, or meditation.

Work to release and replace negative attitudes like complaining and judging as well, because they keep us stuck in the past and feed negativity. Practices such as forgiveness and gratitude are highly effective at releasing negative emotions, thoughts, and energy.

Create a better future

“Did you imagine you could ever be so strong, then watch your fear turn into relief? Your sea of doubt become your own belief?” — Beth Orton

There’s nothing wrong with negative thoughts and emotions.

They can be unpleasant, but they definitely won’t kill us — and there’s value and purpose in their presence.

Holding onto to them is where we get into trouble. And avoiding them is a sure-fire recipe for more pain, shame, and playing small.

So, why not face them instead? Their yours — a highly personal outline of what you’re committed to right now. Use them to correct course and create a better future.

Because it’s not just you who benefits. Your family, friends, and community all profit when you decide for growth and emotional strength.

I promise, it’s not nearly as scary or tough as you imagine!

All you have to do is start.

Make the decision today to be in control of your own emotions.

Then watch, learn, and apply… you’ll be amazed at the personal strength and freedom that results.

And most importantly, you’ll love who you become in the process.",human,human-written

Many people start their journey of NLP and coach training because they are at a ‘cross-roads’ in their life. They are often in a life-transition phase — dealing with big changes, or a lack of purpose — and are looking for some answers.

I have found that people often have a profound sense of guilt that they are not living a more prestigious life and confuse this with lacking vision.

The personal development world is guilty here. YouTube and self-help books are packed with stories giving the impression that a person who lacks a clear vision for their life needs to change dramatically and ‘wake up and smell the coffee.’

But what does this mean in reality, especially if you have responsibilities and lack the resources to ‘jump into the dark’?

Unsure? Have a Go!

Speaking from personal experience, most of the things that people have had success with started with a far more ‘have-a-go’ spirit. It is only in retrospect that my own business looked like it was following a master plan. This reminds me of a story from Apple founder Steve Jobs, who dropped into a few Calligraphy classes while at university and didn’t know why, it just felt right (and didn’t cost much). He went on to invent computer fonts! He explained this using a metaphor: “It was impossible to connect the dots looking forward… but it was very, very clear looking backward ten years later.”

This then brings into question the very word ‘Vision’ — is it a singular thing, or something broader? Does it mean vision for your career, health, creativity, family, wealth, wellbeing, relationships, lifestyle or helping the world? Because, often, people who seem to achieve amazing things in one part of their life, seem to fail spectacularly in others.

Success or Luck?

I also feel some confusion on this matter. I really agree that people should not feel limited about what is possible in their lives. I don’t think it is a good idea to make people who have achieved a stable life (perhaps in a field which they do not consider glamorous enough) feel ashamed of the fact that they are not ‘changing the world’.

Malcolm Gladwell, in his book Outliers, looks back on the monumental success of the computer entrepreneurs and points out that part of their success was luck: right place, right time. Both Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were born in California in 1955 and given early access to computers.

Another popular story is of how Nelson Mandela retained his mental fortitude after 27 years in prison on Robben Island and went on to become a world-renowned leader of his nation. Frankly, I feel I would have crumbled after a few months there!

In the classic crime novel, Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, the lead character commits murder to prove to himself that he has the same ruthless characteristics as Napoleon. In the end, this crime proves to be his undoing and he ultimately confesses to the police.

At the same time, great writers can inspire us to gain hope and achieve things beyond what we thought possible. Here is a wonderful poem, A Splendid Torch, by George Bernard Shaw:

“This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being a force of nature instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.

“I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community, and as long as I live it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can.

I want to be thoroughly used up when I die, for the harder I work the more I live. I rejoice in life for its own sake. Life is no “brief candle” for me. It is a sort of splendid torch which I have got hold of for the moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations.”

Ultimately, each one of us has certain talents, drives, beliefs and energy. Our lives are also hugely influenced by luck and time. I believe that, in the vast majority of cases, people’s lives follow a far more haphazard path than the purveyors of ‘Vision’ preach. Personally, my vision is to have a balanced and happy life and I do not want to pay the price of chasing incredible success — possibly because I know I lack the qualities needed to achieve it. What I do feel very strongly about is that, unless vision is something which can improve the quality of life, the answer is to do a few inexpensive experiments (which feel right) and see if any of them take off.

And, who knows, maybe ten years later, you may even be seen as a visionary!",human,human-written

"When asked in several forums last week after the Suns drafted two more teenagers to add to All-Rookie teenager Devin Booker, General Manager Ryan McDonough hedged away from clear statements on the Suns' expectations regarding the playoffs next year.

For the third summer in a row, he has alternated between saying they are committing to their young players while also expecting to fight for a playoff position. The results in the last two seasons have been predictably frustrating - it's almost impossible to truly rebuild while also competing for a playoff spot.

So it's time to go back to the 2013 plan.

After successfully adding two high-ceiling teenage forwards - Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss - and a pace-pushing point guard Tyler Ulis last Thursday night to supplement their existing young guns Alex Len (23), T.J. Warren (22), Archie Goodwin (21) and Devin Booker (19), McDonough is becoming more and more comfortable with setting low expectations for the coming season.

""I don't want to set unrealistic expectation for the team, to set us up so to speak,"" McDonough said to Bright Side in a one-on-one last Friday. ""Next year my guess is that externally expectations will be low.""

The Suns rotation will almost certainly boast three teenagers on opening night, making up three of the 15 youngest players in the entire league.

But he couldn't help throwing a bit of optimism out there with the memory of the 2013 Suns who were picked to finish 14th in the West.

""As you know, externally, three years ago expectations were extremely low and we won 48 games.""

Frankly, McDonough is in a very tough position. The Suns have missed the playoffs for six consecutive seasons - a franchise record worst - and many of the season ticket holders are either declining to renew or openly grumbling about wanting to watch a better product.

Another challenge has been managing partner Robert Sarver, who sides with the season ticket holders on wanting a playoff team in Talking Stick Resort Arena not named 'Rattlers'. But even Sarver seemed content with growing with the kids when he ambled through media row on draft night after the big moves and reminded us with a smile, ""Remember, they're only 36 years old combined.""

Until last Thursday night, the Suns still didn't have a solid foundation of players on whom to hope for perennial playoff contention. For the past six years, the Suns have not boasted a single All-Star, nor have they developed any players who project to be named to multiple All-NBA teams.

But now, one could easily make the case that the future of the Suns franchise is in the hands of a trio of healthy, high-ceiling teeenagers several years away from major contract demands.

Devin Booker, Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss are a great start on a new foundation upon which Alex Len, T.J. Warren, Tyler Ulis and Archie Goodwin can develop. None of those seven players will be over 23 next year. Even Brandon Knight is only 24, and Eric Bledsoe is only 27. The only ""old"" guys the Suns have to set the competitive tone are P.J. Tucker (31) and Tyson Chandler (34).

Booker came out of the late lottery to be the third youngest ever to score 30+ points, one of only four teenagers ever to have 6+ 30-point games (others: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony) and become the fourth youngest player ever to score 1,000 points. The only others on this one? LeBron James. Kevin Durant. Kobe Bryant.

Bender has been on NBA radars for three years already, and been projected all along as one of the best prospects in the world, predicted to go at or near the top of his draft as soon as he's old enough to join the NBA.

And Bledsoe was playing at an All-Star level more than once the past three years, only to be scuttled by injuries time and again.

""We like our young talent,"" McDonough said.

Now he is preaching patience, and dabbing in a bit of optimism.

""We're excited about what these guys can do,"" McDonough said. ""They are talented guys, and like you saw last year with Devin Booker, some of these guys just figure it out quicker than others and you have something special.""

Don't expect either of Bender or Chriss to be as NBA ready as Devin Booker, but maybe we can see some flashes of the future. Bender, in particular, has been playing professionally for years now though he mostly sat on the bench for a very veteran Maccabi Tel-Aviv team this past year, which lowered his draft stock to where the Suns could grab him with the 4th selection.

Free agency starts next week, but the Suns figure to approach free agency much like they approached it in 2013. That summer, they stayed away from the big-money free agents and focused on balancing out the roster.

Depth Chart

This summer, the roster is deep already. There are no glaring holes needing bodies. What the Suns really need is to cull the excess to enhance playing opportunities for their best young players.

PG: Eric Bledsoe, Brandon Knight, Tyler Ulis (R)

SG: Devin Booker, Brandon Knight, Archie Goodwin, John Jenkins

SF: P.J. Tucker, T.J. Warren, Dragan Bender (R)

PF: Dragan Bender (R), Marquese Chriss (R), Alan Williams

C: Tyson Chandler, Alex Len, Dragan Bender (R)

Salary Cap Update

The $35 million is a MAXIMUM amount of money the Suns could spend in free agency, and only if they release Tucker, Jenkins, Williams and (after signing him) Ulis AND renounce their cap holds on Mirza Teletovic, Ronnie Price, Chase Budinger and Jon Leuer.

Cap Holds

The Suns have four unrestricted free agents, who each have a ""cap hold"" on the Suns salary cap to various degrees for the Suns to retain their 'Bird Rights'. Bird rights allows you to offer higher maximum salaries, a fifth year, and to exceed the salary cap to re-sign them.

The Suns won't need those Bird Rights on any of these guys. If the Suns renounce those rights, they can still sign any and all of these players to regular contracts just like any other team.

They might re-sign Mirza Teletovic or Jon Leuer, as well as Ronnie Price for some continuity. But none of them will command salaries in excess of what other teams could offer.

Final Word

McDonough might not chase the biggest free agents next week, but he won't shut the door on a cinderella season. He's seen it in Phoenix in 2013. And he saw it last year up in the Pacific Northwest.

""We could use what Portland did last year as a blueprint,"" McDonough said. ""They were picked to finish 14th or 15th in the West. I'm not saying we will be that, I don't know where we will be picked. But we kind of embrace the underdog role. Especially with the age of our team.""",human,human-written

The Volkswagen Group on Monday gave an update on progress of its modular platform for non-premium cars, known as MEB, an acronym for the German translation of “Modular Electric Toolkit.”
The automaker said 27 models spread across four brands (likely Volkswagen, Skoda, Seat and Audi) will be available by the end of 2022, ranging from compact cars up to a modern successor to the iconic Microbus.
This will be in addition to models based on VW Group's premium electric car platforms like the C-BEV debuting in the Audi e-tron, the J1 debuting in the Porsche Taycan, and a new PPE platform currently being developed by Audi and Porsche and due to spawn its first model in 2021.

With these additional platforms, plus a potential SPE platform for electric sports cars, VW Group is targeting close to 80 electric cars across all of its brands by 2025. The cost of developing them is proving to be more expensive than originally envisaged, though. The automaker has currently set aside $7 billion for electric car development.
""The burden for our company, such as the cost of bringing to market electric cars, will be higher than expected,” CEO Herbert Diess said. “This is particularly so since some of our competitors have been making more progress.""
The MEB platform is the most important for the automaker, as the cars based on it will be more affordable and sell in higher volumes than models based on the group's other electric car platforms. VW Group sees the platform as being instrumental in transforming the electric car from a niche product into a true alternative to cars with conventional powertrains. VW Group likens the introduction as monumental as the transition from the Volkswagen Beetle to the Golf.
Left to right: Volkswagen ID, ID Buzz and ID Crozz concepts
So what can we expect of cars based on the MEB platform. “The cars hold the road really well thanks to the flat battery in the floorpan and the space inside is much more generous—we are making substantial headway with the sense of spaciousness,” Christian Senger, VW Group's head of electric cars, said. He also said they will incorporate fast-charging and promised an 80-percent charge in about 30 minutes. The automaker is keeping quiet on the all-important range figure but has hinted at the minimum being somewhere around 250 miles.
The first car based on the MEB platform will be a production version of 2016's VW ID hatchback concept. The hatch, which will be slightly larger than a Golf, is already being tested as a prototype and due to enter production at a plant in Zwickau, Germany at the end of 2019.
Other cars that we know are coming include production versions of VW's ID Crozz crossover and ID Buzz van concepts unveiled in 2017. The Buzz is a preview of the aforementioned Microbus successor. Both vehicles are expected after 2020.

Recently, I was given a task to dedupe a dataset using Apache spark. There were different ways I considered to accomplish it. Some of them are pretty well known and straight out of the box. In this article I would like to talk about some of them and what how they could be used depending on the use case. I will use Scala for writing all of the code.

Fimport spark.implicits._ val installsDF = Seq(

(""01/01/2020"", ""a"", 123),(""01/02/2020"", ""b"", 234),

(""01/03/2020"", ""a"", 345),(""01/04/2020"", ""b"", 234),

(""01/01/2020"", ""a"", 123),(""01/05/2020"", ""x"", 567) ).toDF(""installDate"", ""userId"", ""appId"") installsDF.show(false)

+-----------+------+-----+

|installDate|userId|appId|

+-----------+------+-----+

|01/01/2020 |a |123 |

|01/02/2020 |b |234 |

|01/03/2020 |a |345 |

|01/04/2020 |b |234 |

|01/01/2020 |a |123 |

|01/05/2020 |x |567 |

+-----------+------+-----+

Based on different scenarios, one may need to eliminate duplicates differently.

distinct()

Using .distinct to de-dupe, is the very first way that may come to anyone’s mind. Its pretty standard and quick way to eliminate duplicates if one has to drop identical duplicate rows. .distinct() or simply .distinct will de-dupe the DataFrame by considering all columns. Calling installsDF.distinct() will give us something like this:

+-----------+------+-----+

|installDate|userId|appId|

+-----------+------+-----+

|01/01/2020 |a |123 |

|01/05/2020 |x |567 |

|01/03/2020 |a |345 |

|01/04/2020 |b |234 |

|01/02/2020 |b |234 |

+-----------+------+-----+

dropDuplicates() / dropDuplicates(Seq<String> colNames)

Another way is to use .dropDuplicates. I think .dropDuplicates was introduced since Apache Spark 1.4. Simply calling .dropDuplicates() without any arguments behaves like calling .distinct() . Calling .dropDuplicates(Seq<String> colNames) gives us the flexibility of using only particular columns as a condition to eliminate partially identical rows. Calling installsDF.dropDuplicates(""userId"", ""appId"") will give us something of the either two below:

+-----------+------+-----+

|installDate|userId|appId|

+-----------+------+-----+

|01/01/2020 |a |123 |

|01/03/2020 |a |345 |

|01/05/2020 |x |567 |

|01/02/2020 |b |234 |

+-----------+------+-----+

we don’t get the following since, user id b’s 4th day entry comes after 2nd day and the RDD is small enough to fit into one partition.

+-----------+------+-----+

|installDate|userId|appId|

+-----------+------+-----+

|01/01/2020 |a |123 |

|01/03/2020 |a |345 |

|01/05/2020 |x |567 |

|01/04/2020 |b |234 |

+-----------+------+-----+

reduceByKey(func: (V, V) ⇒ V): RDD[(K, V)]

Lets say I want to find the apps installed by a user along with its first install date. Using dropDuplicates, seemed to be giving a similar result but if the records arrived out of order, then it fails to give the right result. In this case, I can use reduceByKey. For this first I will have to convert the RDD into a pairRDD and include installDate and userId as the key and appId as the value.

import org.joda.time.DateTime

import org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormat installsDF

.map( r=> ((r.getAs[String](""userId""), r.getAs[Integer](""appId"")), r.getAs[String](""installDate"") ))

.rdd

.reduceByKey( (x,y) => {

val pattern = ""MM/dd/yyyy""

val installDateMillis1 = DateTime.parse(x, DateTimeFormat.forPattern(pattern)).getMillis

val installDateMillis2 = DateTime.parse(y, DateTimeFormat.forPattern(pattern)).getMillis if(installDateMillis1 < installDateMillis2) x else y

} ).map{case((userId, appId), (installDate)) => (installDate, userId, appId)}

.toDF(""installDate"", ""userId"", ""appId"")

.show(false)

+-----------+------+-----+

|installDate|userId|appId|

+-----------+------+-----+

|01/02/2020 |b |234 |

|01/01/2020 |a |123 |

|01/05/2020 |x |567 |

|01/03/2020 |a |345 |

+-----------+------+-----+

Using reduceByKey should help in many of the dedup cases, but there is an exclusive condition wherein reduceByKey will be unusable. If there was a case where there were more than 22 columns in keys or values, then Scala tuple’s 22 element limit kicks in. This can be mitigated with a change in design of the RDD by reducing the columns.

Window Function

In cases where the 22 column limit cannot be avoided, one can resort to using Spark Sql’s window function to perform dedupe. To tackle the same problem of finding apps installed by a user along with its first install date, one needs to partition the RDD by userId and appId, ascending sort the installDate column( by converting installDate to unix timestamp), provide a rank to each row and then filter for rows with rank 1.

import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions._ val windowConf = Window.partitionBy(""userId"",""appId"").orderBy(unix_timestamp($""installDate"",""MM/dd/yyyy"").cast(""timestamp”).asc) installsDF

.withColumn(""rank"", row_number().over(windowConf))

.filter($""rank"" === 1)

.show(false)

+-----------+------+-----+----+

|installDate|userId|appId|rank|

+-----------+------+-----+----+

|01/01/2020 |a |123 |1 |

|01/03/2020 |a |345 |1 |

|01/05/2020 |x |567 |1 |

|01/02/2020 |b |234 |1 |

+-----------+------+-----+----+

collect_set(Column e)

Another way of performing a deduping is using collect_set function from spark sql. Its not actually deduping but collapsing records by performaing a groupBy and collecting the unique values for a column related to each group.",human,human-written
"Professor Thomas Davenport of Babson College, Harvard Business School and the MIT Sloan School of Management delivered his keynote address on the history of data analytics at Open Data Science Conference East 2017 in Boston, titled Four Eras of Analytics and Data Science.

Prof. Davenport’s speech covered the span of data analytics from a business perspective, beginning in the 1970s up through modern times, breaking the practice out into four main eras.

The history of data science is extraordinarily brief compared to the long arcs of biology, chemistry, and other disciplines. Nonetheless, this history rich in its own way, drawn from a group of movers and shakers that contrasts sharply with the academics who established the study of the physical world centuries before. Read on to get a sense of how we got from ‘back room’ analysts to the ‘sexiest job of the 21st Century’.

Era One: Artisanal Analytics

According to Prof. Davenport’s view, data analytics commenced in earnest with what he dubs “artisanal analytics” in 1975. This methodology was primarily geared towards producing insights for internal decision-making using small-scale, structured datasets.

From an organizational perspective, the analyst of the 1970s played a fundamentally different role than the modern data scientist. Analysts weren’t creating customer-facing tools that could be reused. Instead, they honed in on predictive models based on human hypotheses that took significant amounts of time to refine. This meant that the analyst wasn’t out front, but more of a “back room” support member, in Dr. Davenport’s phrasing.

Davenport points out that this form of analysis isn’t gone, but it has taken a backseat to other techniques capable of discovering insights without human intervention, such as machine learning. Still, the artisanal analysts did make significant contributions which continue to be used, such as business-oriented statistics and rudimentary visualization.

Era Two: Big Data Analytics

As Silicon Valley began to boom in the late ’90s and early 2000s, the volume and variety of data available for the analyst ballooned. With the new challenges that this changing landscape provided, a new title entered the lexicon: the data scientist.

Davenport remarked, “I must confess that when I first started hearing about big data and data scientists and so on, I wasn’t entirely sure that this was anything really that different from the sort of analytics that I had been talking about and writing about. So I started to study them.”

Davenport began collaborating with Dhanurjay “DJ” Patil, who would go on to become the first Chief Data Scientist of the United States Office of Science and Technology Policy. In their conversations, Patil’s remarks proved instructive on the dividing line between the analyst and the data scientist. According to Davenport, Patil would say that “data scientists need to be on the bridge… right up there with Captain Kirk,” taking charge of the decision-making process rather than supporting leaders from the rear.

In Davenport’s opinion, “Supporting managerial decision-making? That’s the dead zone.”

Era Three: Data Economy Analytics

Before and around 2013, another major change occurred. As massive tech firms found new ways of wrangling their outsized datasets, they also found new ways of commoditizing them. In addition to building products around the datasets they maintained — the model companies had used for nearly forty years, in Davenport’s framing — they also began to sell the data they were collecting from users.

In Davenport’s words, “industrialized decision-making at scale” became the new way of leveraging data, acting on changes as rapidly as new information was coming in. At this point, business analytics became almost unrecognizable next Davenport’s first era, where models were unreactive to new information — especially since so little new information was entering the picture at any moment. Now, companies were not only able to collect information from users and sell it as a commodity, they were also able to change their strategies on the fly, automatically.

Era Four: Autonomous Analytics

According to Davenport, we have just entered a new era of analytics in the past year, characterized by an even stronger role for autonomous decision-making — probably the loosest definition of artificial intelligence.

In this model, machines not only perform the analysis; they also act on the insights, making decisions faster and more efficiently than any human could.

Davenport’s stands apart from many automation alarmists who often stake the claim that AI and machine learning methods will obsolesce existing jobs. From his perspective, data scientists who refuse to update their toolboxes are the ones in the crosshairs. As he puts it, “the only people who are going to lose their jobs are the people who don’t embrace these new technologies.”

Above all else, Prof. Davenport emphasized that the modern data scientist is tasked with understanding the full breadth of techniques, from the ones the ‘back room’ analysts embraced in the ’70s to the sophisticated deep learning methods that are currently in vogue. Fortunately, many of these techniques logically build off of each other, and if you are already familiar with the precursors, it’s relatively easy to pick up new methods.

"I’m not religious. I grew up Roman Catholic and never really “found myself” at church. To be completely honest, I never really understood it.

Why couldn’t I believe in God on my own time? Why were there all these stories? Why did I need to eat bread and drink wine?

The ritualistic ideology behind the Catholic religion had pushed me away; so far, I found a new religion that I thought suited me way better.

Buddhism.

In light of the dark ages, and by that, I mean my depression, I needed something to believe in. I needed something to give me clarity, something to follow that made me feel better, just something.

I stumbled on the book, The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari and consumed the entire book within two days. I was fascinated.

Imagine a book that’s half self-help and half-spiritual guidance. This book illustrated the means of finding inner peace in a world full of stress and destruction. I’m not going to summarize the book; I think everyone should read or listen to it to gain all the knowledge I took away from it.

But I will tell you all what I did after reading it. What inspired me to embark on a journey to mental clarity, joy, and fulfillment.

1. Forgiveness

Surprisingly this was the hardest one.

You can’t live a happy life when feeling hatred toward others. It doesn’t even have to be hatred; it can be any internal resentment toward another person that creates negative energy when you are around them.

I had memories engrained in my head from my childhood — things people did, words that were said, actions that were done. Letting go of the past, and forgiving others for what they did, lifted an intangible weight off my chest, one I didn’t even know I had.

I now let go of past anger and sadness and replace it with gratitude for the lessons I have learned and how they have made me stronger.

It’s all about perspective.

2. Mindfulness

Any Buddhist will tell you that being in the now is the most important part of enlightenment.

I had always struggled with being present. I dwelled about the past, worried about the future. I still do, and it’s something I work on daily.

Every day I sit and meditate. Only 5 minutes sometimes, or maybe 10. The days I meditate for 20 or more, are some of the most peaceful days of my life.

The act of sitting still with your mind, having no thoughts running through it, and just focusing on your breath, is something that I never thought would change me as much as it did.

I go through my days sometimes and think, “Wow, I need to meditate.”

Meditation helps my mind function clearer, my thoughts make more sense, and my emotions run less wild. I feel centered and calm and can think at a much higher level than I ever could before.

3. Journal

This is another one that I can’t help but feel the need to do throughout my day.

I always have an intense craving to write. Maybe that’s why I’m on Medium.

The art of journaling makes my mind less crowded and more clear. Think about it, or maybe don’t. We have so many thoughts running through our minds every day. Being able to get them out and sort them on paper gives reasoning and purpose to what our thoughts mean.

Journaling creates an outlet for ideas, thoughts, and emotions. Some of the most significant people in history have kept a journal, Leonardo Da Vinci, Benjamin Franklin, and Anne Frank.

I have almost finished my first journal and am looking forward to staring a new one.

4. Gratitude

It’s human nature to strive to be better and more successful. But what if you took a step back and looked at what you already have.

My journal consists of some entries where I just wrote down a page of everything I am grateful for: Family, clothes, food, my computer.

Expressing gratitude gives us a boost in our everyday life. It shows us how much we already have, how lucky we are to have it, and how much more we need to recognize it’s existence.

Those days I’m feeling down, I remind myself of everything amazing about my life. It gives me this incredible joy that life is a precious thing, and I am lucky enough to be living in it.

5. Nourish

Before I became interested in Buddhism, I was already eating a vegan diet. Many Buddhists don’t eat meat, which made me instantly feel a connection to the morals of the Buddhist religion.

You don’t need to be vegan or even vegetarian to align yourself with the values of Buddhism. There are some Buddhists who eat meat, but many do not due to this principle:

Besides the meat-eating factor, many Buddhists eat whole foods. They eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes. They eat to feel good and be in prime health conditions. It’s no secret that the healthier you eat, the better you feel.

Health is wealth.

6. Minimalism

Many Buddhists don’t live lavishly. They don’t need Gucci or Chanel to feel fulfilled. That’s not what life is about.

Minimalism doesn’t have to be you own one plate and have one piece of furniture. It can be that you don’t buy things to be happy.

You don’t need another sweater when you already have ten perfectly nice ones in your closet. Many of us buy things to make us feel fulfilled, but that joy only lasts so long. The idea that money doesn’t buy happiness is one that I came to see quickly in my life.

I realized I could have many things at a young age, but gift after gift, you get bored with them quickly. I learned to cherish moments and people more than I ever would a new car.

Minimizing your belongings also increases space in your mind. Owning less, you have less responsibility and more freedom. Getting rid of clothes is like getting rid of a burden, and I never fail to feel better after a good closet cleanout.

You don’t need much to be happy.

7. Worship

There is no God in Buddhism.

The Buddha was a man who did not proclaim himself as a God.

This intrigued me the most about this religion. You’re not asked to worship anyone; you are asked to embark on a spiritual journey to attain enlightenment, to work on yourself.

I was able to see life from a brand new perspective after practicing the ideals of Buddhism. I found peace, calm, and harmony, and felt more fulfillment than I ever had.

I hope this is able to help someone find their own path to a better life and a more centered mind.

Namaste.

"There are multiple claims about the potential of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled systems to boost or even transform defence capabilities.

Picture Credit: pexels-pixabay-280002

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming a critical part of modern warfare. Compared with conventional systems, military systems equipped with AI are capable of handling larger volumes of data more efficiently. Additionally, AI improves self-control, self-regulation, and self-actuation of combat systems due to its inherent computing and decision-making capabilities.

However, the most important aspect where AI will play a new role in the coming decade is Mental Health’ as currently 50% of military personnel are likely to suffer from mental illness once in their lifetime. The major reason for this large number is because there are very fewer measures taken in the diagnosis due to a large number of redeployed veterans. It is compounded by the fact that active-duty personnel and veterans are too often reluctant, indeed overtly deterred from seeking mental health care because of shame, stigma, and adverse career impact.

Unfortunately, while models of early intervention have been tested in non-military populations, they have rarely been implemented in military personnel.

Picture Credit: pexels-Yogendra-singh-2450439

While a system exists to take care of those who have been through trauma; there is a need to address this more scientifically and help those who are affected; especially in the Indian Defence Services.

Communication Designers Shalini Chandak & Shrushti Gala -ISDI Parsons (AIML |A Whole New World) With the help of voice and image analysis integrated into an app, aim to help with the early diagnosis of mental illness in military personnel. Early diagnosis could help in providing early and better treatment to the military personnel which in turn could lead to less number of people suffering from mental illness. This could be helpful in the defence sector to keep a track of mental illness of large number deployed military personnel. This aid will help in determining the military force if a soldier is suffering from any kind of mental illness after they come back from a posting and will be able to provide them with better care.

VOICE ANALYSIS:

Using language for diagnosis is as old as the field of psychiatry itself. Sigmund Freud was famously inspired by slips of the tongue, which he believed could reveal unconscious urges. A growing body of evidence suggests that an array of mental conditions can make you slur your words, elongate sounds, or speak in a more nasal tone.

They may even make your voice creak or jitter so briefly that it’s not detectable to the human ear. An interactive voice application using artificial intelligence can determine if a person is suffering from any kind of mental illness based on their tone and words they use.

In work supported by the Department of Defense, for instance, a team of researchers from New York University’s Langone Medical Center published results showing that their program had identified imperceptible features of the voice that can be used to diagnose PTSD with 89% accuracy.

IMAGE ANALYSIS

The present study examined the validity of a novel physiological measurement technology called Transdermal Optical Imaging (TOI) technology at assessing basal stress. So when we experience different emotions our facial blood flow changes subtly. By looking at these facial blood changes we can reveal people’s hidden emotions which cannot be detected by the human eye. This technology conveniently, contactless, inexpensively and remotely measures facial blood flow changes using a conventional digital video camera. Using this technology we can monitor a person’s heart rate, stress level, mood and whether or not they experience any kind of pain with an accuracy of about 90 %.

The problem of stigma is, of course, worldwide, but it may have a particularly strong valence in the military, where having a psychiatric diagnosis is believed to doom one’s military career. It is believed that veterans with a delayed diagnosis become more severely ill than those recognised soon after the initial experience. Early diagnosis can increase functional capacity, rapid symptom recovery, prevention of maladaptive coping behaviours, and prevention of chronic PTSD and other psychopathology, including complicated grief.

The Indian Armed Forces, have lost 900 soldiers to suicide in the last seven years.To put it in context, that is almost twice the number of soldiers lost in the Kargil War (527).

Shalini Chandak &Shrushti Gala — Campaign for INDIA

Communication Designers Shalini Chandak & Shrushti Gala -ISDI Parsons (AIML |A Whole New World) also devised a Communication campaign which can make space for this conversation to take place for individual healing as well as a collective intention for well-being keeping various cultural context in mind and make meaningful changes in many lives.

Practising self-care towards a new perspective which allows us to rise above our impulses.

To consider and contemplate situations that allows us to choose how to respond, engage and interact and not lose ourselves in them.

According to the report, minister of state for defence Subhash. Bhamre, in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha, said 84 soldiers had committed suicide in 2014, 78 in 2015 and 104 in 2016. There were at least 83 cases of fratricide in the army, navy and air force between 2000 and 2012, according to figures submitted by the defence ministry in Parliament.

Shalini Chandak & Shrushti Gala —Designed a campaign keeping in mind the global context. It is inspired by the campaign done by ‘Samaritan UK wherein they encourage people to share their stories about mental illness. A series of posters depicting stories of different soldiers who have fought mental illness will hopefully break the stigma around mental illness and encourage other soldiers to seek medical help.

AI is an enabling technology that can be used in diverse domains of military activity — everything from weapons systems, intelligence, logistics, and training to the learning tools employed in professional military education, Mental health’ is the next obvious step.

"An airline passenger saw a man sitting in front of her texting about sexually abusing children and used her own cell phone to capture his conversation, police said.

The alert woman then quietly notified crew members on the Seattle-to-San-Jose Southwest Airlines flight. They contacted authorities, leading to the man’s arrest when the jet touched down at Norm Mineta International Airport, according to investigators.

Michael Kellar, 56, was arrested on one charge of soliciting a sex crime and two counts of attempted child molestation, according to the San Jose Police Department.

The woman he was allegedly texting, Gail Burnworth, 50, was arrested at her Tacoma, Washington, home on charges of sexually exploiting a minor, child rape and dealing in child pornography, police said.

Kellar is also from Tacoma. He is being held without bail in California’s Santa Clara County Jail, online records show.

Burnworth is being held in lieu of $1 million bail at the Pierce County Jail, according to online records.

Neither has entered a plea.

Kellar was using a large-screen smart phone with an enlarged font on board the flight, police said. The woman sitting in the row behind him could see his texts and took photos of them with her cellphone, police said.

Kellar was allegedly talking to Burnworth about two children, ages 5 and 7, who are the abuse victims, investigators said.

The children lived with Burnworth, police said, but their relationship was not revealed.

Kellar initially told officers he had done nothing wrong and was only engaging in role playing and sexual fantasy during his text conversations with Burnworth, police said.

Seattle detectives and FBI agents are investigating the case with the San Jose Police Department’s Internet Crimes Against Children task force.

The Specialty Equipment Manufacturer's Association show in Las Vegas is best know as the showcase for performance and customization parts from aftermarket suppliers. However, the mainstream automakers use the show to introduce new models and accessory parts of their own. At this year's show, Chevrolet went all-out with a blitz of Chevrolet Performance Parts for the Camaro, Corvette, Cruze, Sonic, Silverado, Colorado, as well as new crate engines and a new, er, crate transmission.
The crate engines start with the LT376/535. This new crate engine is based on the production LT1 V-8 engine from the Corvette Stingray and Camaro SS. It gets a unique high-performance camshaft and CNC-ported cylinder heads. As a result, it puts out 535 naturally aspirated horsepower at 6,300 rpm and 470 pound-feet of torque at 4,600 rpm. That's 80 more horses than in the Camaro SS. This engine can be yours for $13,750.
Chevrolet Perfromance Parts LT376/535 crate engine
Next up is the SP350/357. This carbureted V-8 takes the popular 350 H.O. crate engine to a new level, adding a hydraulic roller camshaft, the latest Small Block intake manifold design, and high-flow Vortec cylinder heads. As a result it puts out 357 hp and 407 lb-ft of torque. The cost is $7,250 in its turn-key configuration.
Chevrolet's 455-hp LT1 6.2L crate engine is now available in Connect & Cruise and E-ROD packages. With the Connect & Cruise package, the LT1 comes with a wet sump and the new 8L90-E 8-speed automatic transmission. The Connect & Cruise E-ROD system adds catalytic converters and other emissions components to make it CARB-compliant for 1996 and earlier vehicles in California.
That 8L90-E 8-speed automatic transmission is also now offered ready to use on LT1 and LT4 crate engines. It fits in the same space as GM’s family of 6-speed automatics. The price is $5,000 for the LT1 and $5,210 for the LT4.
Chevrolet was keen to point out that its line of Chevrolet Performance Parts are engineered, tested, and designed by the same engineers that created the cars for which they are intended. These parts are also backed by Chevrolet, and they don't void the manufacturer's warranty. Here is a list of what was unveiled at SEMA:

Team task management has always been an important issue with companies, but statistics show that the shift to remote is making the issue more apparent. One survey showed that as many as 88% of remote workers felt that they were dealing with inconsistent leadership and communication with other team members.

Poor team management can cost your companies in a number of different ways:

U.S. businesses lose $1 trillion each year due to employee turnover and associated costs. Poor management is one of the most frequently cited reasons why employees leave.

Employees that decide not to leave may simply have less motivation to go about their jobs, leading to poor quality of work.

If reputation spreads in your industry that you are a poorly managed company, it can become harder to retain talent.

The silver lining here is that there are a lot of steps that companies can take today to improve their team task management. Here are some key options.

1. Onboarding For Managers

One surprising statistic that doesn’t get discussed a lot is that as many as 58% of managers say they didn’t get any sort of formal management training. This is a situation that you want to avoid at all costs. Think about it. The bulk of new management professionals at a company fall into one of two categories:

People brought in from outside of an organization to lend their expertise

People promoted internally from being part of a team to managing it

In both cases, there’s a huge amount of information that needs to be communicated so they can do their job effectively. This ranges from how your workflow may differ from other companies in your industry to simply knowing the chain of command for communication. Companies should invest heavily in an onboarding program for team task management the same as they would for any other new employee. This allows them to start contributing to your team faster. In addition, if everyone is working from the same base set of guidelines, it’s easier to determine whether someone is doing their job properly or not.

2. Take An Assessment of Team Skills And Delegate

While you may have several employees working on the same team, the chances are that individuals are going to be most effective at certain tasks. This can be due to past experience that they have or simply discovering a new skill or aptitude at their company. One good practice for team task management is doing an internal survey on who on your team is best at certain tasks. This can be done as formally or informally as you want. You just want to have a record as a manager. This way, if you have a surplus of tasks in one category, you know who you can delegate to.

The delegation, in and of itself, has a certain art to it. You need to have the following company traits for delegation to work.

Enough internal trust that your employees can complete tasks assigned to you.

Communication channels employees can use in case they have questions.

Understanding that a manager is essential, but not always directly involved.

3. Implementing Positivity When Possible (And Feasible)

When the work starts to pile up, it’s easy for company morale to start sinking. Along with the basics of team task management, it’s also important for managers to make sure that their employees stay motivated, even when things get difficult. Here are a few steps that you can take in this area:

Making sure to recognize moments of success that your team members have. This helps show that their efforts are appreciated.

Implementing team-building efforts. A team that knows each other on a personal level can help build professional bonds that will strengthen their work quality.

Practicing measured honesty. You don’t necessarily want to be a prophet of doom, but a little understanding when employees are in a difficult situation will show them that their concerns are not ignored.

4. Practice Transparency

It may sound like a common buzzword, but the fact of the matter is that transparency is important for team task management. As many as 50% of employees feel that their workplace is being held back by a lack of transparency.

One of the key ways to do this is by opening up a feedback channel. When it comes to team task management, this takes multiple forms. The obvious one is having a way for employees to offer input, questions or concerns about the workload that they are tasked with. It’s always better to have questions at the onset of a project than deeper into it, when serious work/manhours may have already been invested into it.

There’s also a company culture element to practicing transparency. Your employees need to feel comfortable and confident enough to express themselves and their feelings so that when issues do arise, they can get addressed right away.

5. Know Your Team Time Regimen

Part of the reason why there can be friction between management and employees when it comes to team task management plans is a disconnect with bandwidth expectations. Management may allot a certain amount of time for certain tasks, but in reality, it may take longer to complete said tasks. This leads to management assuming their teams are inefficient or lazy, while the team feels like they are being set up to fail.

Managing the issue isn’t as easy as it may seem, as management doesn’t have the bandwidth to orbit their teams for every single task they do. There is a way to fully understand your team’s work capacity with minimal investment, though, and that’s through using time tracking software platforms like actiTIME. This platform gives you concrete information on how projects are going and how much time is being spent on tasks without infringing on employee privacy.

This is a great asset for team task management. Managers have concrete data on how long given tasks are taking, which means they can either account for that in their management strategy or target inefficiencies. In either event, actiTIME gives teams the tools they need for a stronger internal workflow.",human,human-written
"I was scrolling through my email one morning last March when a message catapulted me back to an earlier time of baseball cards, bell bottoms and biology homework. One of my college roommates sent a link to a morning headline -- ""Hedge Fund Manager Dead in Apparent Suicide."" The man had jumped from the 24th floor of a Manhattan hotel. My roommate’s note was terse: ""It's Chuck Murphy.""Charlie Murphy and I met in Ms. Puccio's homeroom class in 1974, when we were 13 years old. We were entering sophomores at Stuyvesant High School, a public New York City high school that specializes in math and science. Charlie was a nice guy, friendly and soft-spoken. Also very tall -- with inches yet to grow.We had all the same classes our first semester, and we ran with the same pack of friends for a while. Though Charlie and I didn’t really become friends ourselves, we stayed abreast of each other -- not least because we saw each other every morning in homeroom.Stuyvesant was -- and is -- a crucible of high-pressured academic competition. I did well there, and discovered an interest in tournament chess. Charlie also did well. We both wound up at Columbia University, where we began school together once more.At Columbia, Charlie exercised the prerogative of many a college student: he reinvented himself. He started calling himself Chuck, and he joined the preppy fraternity. He dressed the part, too -- I saw him in black tie on more than one weekend.Charlie also went out for crew. As a senior, he captained the crew team. That same year, I became captain of the chess team. We would say hello when our paths crossed, but they didn't cross often.Still, Charlie's personal transformation stuck in my mind. After a while, I figured out why. He chose to shed his skin, to efface his past. But that skin he was shedding -- well, it was the skin I still wore. That past he was erasing was the past we shared.I remember running into Charlie at commencement, where we shook hands in our gowns and congratulated each other. By then, whenever I saw him, I was mostly reminded of the differences between us.***Our paths may have diverged, but our geography remained ironically parallel. Both of us landed at Harvard University in the early 1980s. Charlie (I never got used to calling him Chuck) went to Harvard Law School, and I started the long road to a Ph.D. in English.I had once thought about going to law school myself, and did legal work for a couple of summers during college. But I liked literature better. After vowing on numerous occasions that I would never go to graduate school -- I can still hear myself saying that -- I learned enough about myself to change my mind. So I dug in and tried for a professorship.Charlie and I ran into each other in Harvard Yard sometimes. We always greeted each other warmly, as old familiars, but neither of us asked much about what the other was doing.I heard that Charlie went to Europe after his 1985 graduation to work in banking and finance. I never saw him again. He never wrote to the alumni class notes, either, so his story never advanced for me. He became encased in the amber of memory.But after my roommate’s email, I heard a lot about him. The financial papers descended upon Charlie with prurient zeal. There were stories in The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, Fortune, Barron’s. The Daily Mail weighed in with a heavily illustrated, gossipy account.From these accounts, I learned that Charlie had lived in London for over 20 years before coming back to New York in 2007. Upon his return, he paid $33 million for a townhouse with 11 fireplaces, in the same part of Manhattan where he grew up.Charlie had been a highflier, working first for Morgan Stanley, then for start-ups and hedge funds. His work, I realized, lay behind stories I’ve read in the business pages of the newspapers. One of his last deals aimed at the breakup of AIG, the insurance giant whose failure contributed to the 2008 financial crash.Charlie made some good bets over the years -- the Journal estimated his worth in the tens of millions of dollars. He also made some bad ones: the hedge fund he joined upon his return to the United States had invested heavily in Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. At the time of his death, Charlie was a partner at a different firm, and his home was for sale for $42.5 million.Charlie had been known in his profession as Charles. His name had changed yet again, but so had something else. The financier described in his obituaries wasn’t remotely like the Charlie Murphy I remembered: Charles Murphy was ""rigid"" and ""confrontational."" ""Conversations with Mr. Murphy,"" reported The Wall Street Journal, ""amounted to lectures."" A 30-minute phone call with him meant ""29 minutes of Charles talking.""***Call me an English professor (because I became one), but these accounts initially recalled for me Theodore Dreiser's fictionalized portrayal of the tall, handsome, daring financier Frank Cowperwood in three novels published between 1912 and 1947. One of the words Dreiser often attaches to Cowperwood is ""force."" The mystery Dreiser sets up but does not solve over the course of more than a thousand pages is what makes Cowperwood always want more: more money, more women, more art for his collection. ""I satisfy myself,"" Cowperwood often says. But he's never satisfied.My thoughts eventually fixed on Edwin Arlington Robinson's 1897 poem ""Richard Cory."" The title character is ""a gentleman from sole to crown, / Clean favored and imperially slim."" Cory is ""richer than a king"" and ""admirably schooled in every grace.""In 1965, Paul Simon made a song out of Robinson's poem. It appears on Simon and Garfunkel's Sounds of Silence album. Many people of a certain age, including me, first encountered Richard Cory through the song, not the poem. I heard it for the first time a few years before I met Charlie Murphy. The song's out-of-left-field ending (which echoes the poem's) has never left me:My mind was filled with wonder when the evening headlines read:
""Richard Cory went home last night and put a bullet through his head.""I knew Charlie Murphy once. The man his colleagues knew as Charles Murphy I knew not at all. Yet his death haunts me. No one else shared high school, college and graduate school with me.Charlie and I tracked together from our young teens until our midtwenties -- the years when we were choosing our professions. I first read Dreiser and Robinson during those years, and now I see myself turning to the tools of my job to try to make sense of my classmate's suicide.Which I can't, of course -- I hadn’t seen him in more than 30 years. His death is a tragedy for those close to him. For me, it's also a story that vexes me because my emotional connection to it is so hard to understand.The Simon and Garfunkel song conveys a strange sort of self-righteous triumph when Simon sings the ""put a bullet through his head"" line. Simon’s narrator is an unhappy worker in one of Richard Cory’s factories. The singer’s admiration of Richard Cory is matched by his own misery: “I curse the life I’m living/And I curse my poverty.”What lies behind the singer’s defiant tone when he delivers that last line? I’ve devoted my career to questions like that -- and to arguing for why they matter. Does the singer display a poor man's schadenfreude? The smugness of youth? Or the simple joy of someone who sees that he’s still alive?The question has no clear answer -- and that’s one of the reasons we’re still reading and listening to “Richard Cory” after more than 50 years.

"Freebies are a key lead generation strategy, but to get and keep a business lead you need more than just a freebie.

One of the first marketing tools bloggers use are freebies that they offer to followers and future clients. It’s so basic that even new entrepreneurs understand this. The challenge we face as entrepreneurs is to offer a freebie our audience loves without giving away our main product, skill, or service. Offer too much, and they may not need anything else. Offer too little, and it may not be enough to bring them back for more. Using a freebie in the right way was a lesson that taught me why free is never enough.

I have several websites; I’ve chosen to niche down to specific interests that while related are better off separated for SEO and marketing reasons. My original site is about free editors for creating and editing images or graphics for business. On Blue Pen Media, I write about content curation for blogs, blog tech tips, and offer my curation services.

When I was first online, I searched for free stock images I wanted on my websites and social media posts. Plus, I found sites that help me brainstorm my own creative designs. All of the sites I discovered and liked, I compiled into a personal list because there were so many amazingly good ones I couldn’t remember them any other way.

But I noticed a common theme while researching. Some sites offered only freebies using paid advertising or affiliate links as their means of income. Others offered freebies as a way to entice the viewer to paid items. Either way, the concept of free in exchange for something more is the tip of the iceberg. We’re online for the purpose of making a living but selling to strangers presents challenges. We have to introduce ourselves, market our skills, showcase our knowledge to those who know nothing about us.

People trust businesses they know about or have been referred to by a friend. Online business has different challenges than physical business. Being successful online requires an instant level of trust while providing solutions. Because there’s no physical face to face, earning that trust quickly is pretty important. The searching party must trust the person, product, or service they’ve discovered, sometimes without a lot to go by.

Unlike going to a physical store, once that party has left an online site they rarely come back. I know where my favorite department store is in my town. If I decide to shop today, tomorrow, or next month, I know how to get there. If I find an online site I’m interested in and don’t bookmark or sign up I rarely remember if at all what it was called or how to locate it a day, a week, or a month later. That’s the unfortunate part of being online.

That’s why we all use freebies. Offering a freebie is like the first time you meet someone at a party or a friend’s house. You have a brief conversation. You introduce yourself, make small talk, and uncover common interests. Your conversation could lead to a long-term relationship; on the other hand, you could part ways never to see each other again.

That a freebie is your best first impression or introduction; it’s a glimpse of what you “bring to the table”. Still running a successful online business takes more than freebies. Running an online business takes connecting with your followers and clients. They don’t stick around unless they believe you solve a problem, provide a solution, or offer knowledge. Your freebie is that first conversation, that first impression at your friend’s party. It’s your way of introducing yourself without a lot of commitment on their part.

If they decide what you do, know, or say is of value, they’ll come back. If they can find the same elsewhere they may not stick around. Unless what your offer after your freebie is really really useful, entertaining, or unique they might ignore your follow up emails. That’s one important reason that free is not enough; it just gets your foot in the door. It’s always what you do and how you do it afterward that matters.

I’ve learned a lot of lessons about being online. Running a business has many moving parts. Services, skills, or products are at the bullseye of and good business plan; advertising, marketing, and day to day tasks are the concentric rings of support around that core offering. The freebie is just one of those outer concentric rings of support; it’s not enough without the rest.



I can attract attention with a freebie but without real value at the center of my business, I won’t succeed the way I want to. Finding out what the audience is interested in, what they need, what they are searching for is an essential part of success. Advertising and marketing skills and knowledge is another facet of that.

I’ve heard the saying “jack of all trades, master of none”. No one wants to master of none. There isn’t a person I’ve met that doesn’t want to be good at what they do. We want to be the master of that thing they’re interested in. It’s in our competitive natures to try to be the best we can be. Still, as small businesses and entrepreneurs, there’s a bit of “the jack of all trades” requirement when it comes to running an online business. Being a blogger or solo-entrepreneur necessitates wearing a lot of different hats. Marketing, SEO, social media, and content curation are just the tip of the iceberg.

But at the heart of our business, we want to be the best. It’s important to build that trust so our audience believes we have something intrinsic to offer they can’t get elsewhere. That first freebie will start conversations and open doors but it will never be enough unless we build trust and provide value.",human,human-written
"Depending on where you're from and where you've lived in the United States, you probably say things a little differently than people from other parts of the country. You've experienced this, but you've never seen how the regional dialects of the United States break down quite so cleanly.

Ph.D student Joshua Katz has applied some academic rigor to the old ""soda, pop, coke"" debate. Katz studied data from a 122 question survey examining the differences in how we speak across the country, plugging the that data into an interactive heat map displaying the answers to the many questions.

Katz also made a page that allows you to examine the aggregate dialect differences between one city and the rest of the country. For example, Barrett and I are from Washington DC, so I looked up the map below. Who know that we spoke so similarly to people in Florida? Wow.

"Overview

Before we introduce Quality Gates, let’s understand the code analysis process code analysis is an important and necessary item in the agile product development cycle. It should be used to detect any possible failures and defects arising out of the continuous changes in the source codes.

There are a few good reasons why this should be included in the development lifecycle.

It helps in detecting areas in the code that needs refactoring or simplification.

It can help to find the bug early in the development cycle, which means less cost to fix them.

Overall improvement in the quality of the code.

We can define project specific rules which will then be implemented without manual intervention.

More importantly, you can include this within the build process once and use it always without doing anything manually.

Problem Statement

Now let’s talk about the actual problem. sonarqube which is a code analysis tool, helps us gain visibility into our code base. Soon at MIQ, we realized that having visibility into code was not enough and in order to address the issues flagged by code analysis, we had to make use of different data insights that we were getting from sonarqube.

At this point, we realized that we have to uphold certain guidelines and regulate them across all teams within the organization.

Quality Gates was exactly what we needed and this turned out to be the best way to ensure that standards are met and regulated across all the projects in our organization. Quality Gates can be defined as a set of threshold measures set on your project. Few conditions that can be in included are listed below.

Code Coverage > certain value

Number of Blocker issues >certain value

Security Rating / Unit Test Pass Rate etc..

How — Enforce Quality Gates?

In this article, we will show you how to set up Quality Gates in sonarqube and then configure Jenkins job to enforce Quality Gates.

To manage Quality Gates, go to Quality Gates (top menu bar) in sonarqube.

Each Quality Gate condition is a combination of:

measure

period: Value (to date) or New Code (differential value over the New Code period)

comparison operator

warning value (optional)

error value (optional)

For instance, a condition might be:

measure: Blocker issue

period: Value

comparison operator: >

error value: 0

Which can be stated as No blocker issues.

In the example given below, we have configured a quality gate only for the metric called “code coverage” for demo purpose. However, based on your project requirement, you can set up the metrics in your quality gate. For example, the following snapshot shows a few standard metrics that can be configured.

An example — Quality Gates metrics

Jenkins Job setup

At MIQ, we use Jenkins as our CI and sonarqube as a code inspection tool. Therefore, we wanted to force Jenkins’s build job to fail if the code doesn’t meet the specified Quality Gates.

Sample quality gate metrics setup in sonarqube. Configure Jenkins job to fail the build when not meeting Quality Gates.

Prerequisites — Install Jenkins plugin “sonar-quality-gates-plugin” if not already present. Email-ext plugin for Jenkins to be able to send emails. We also need Jenkins job which is already configured with sonar analysis and build for it passing successfully.

For example, here is the snapshot of the Jenkins build job that is currently passing Jenkins build job before Quality Gates setup.

Let’s setup Quality Gates metrics in Sonar. We are going to create a quality gate only for the metric called Code Coverage for demo purpose. But there are more metrics available that you should be selecting while creating quality gates.

Login to sonar > got Quality Gates as shown in the screen below.

Quality Gate — screen shot in sonarqube

Click on create > Add Condition > Choose metrics (In this example, we selected Code Coverage) > select operator along with warning and error threshold.

Create: Quality Gate

Select the project to add Quality Gates. We have selected a sample miqp project. In your case, project name would be different so please change it accordingly.

Add project to Quality Gate

Now go to the Jenkins job and configure the Quality Gate validation.

Click on the job and go to Post-build Actions and provide the project details you have associated with Quality Gate created in the earlier steps.

Post-build action — Enforce Quality Gates

We have configured the project key of miqp sample project along with Job status when sonar analysis fails.

Verify if our build fails after the quality check was enabled.

Post-build notification alert

You can verify the same in the sonarqube server.

Project status on Quality Gate

In the above screenshot, you can verify that the project miqp is reporting WARNING as the code failed to meet the code coverage metric (i.e we set in one of the earlier steps).

Conclusion

In this article, we have shown how you can take your code analysis benefits to the next level using Quality Gates. We also walked you through the process of setting up Quality Gates at build level, using sonarqube and Jenkins.

This definitely helped the teams at MiQ by being on top of our quality control check and that too in automated fashion. We are sure that this process can help you in your development process as well.",human,human-written
"Bernie Sanders supporters accompanied their political hero as he and his wife, Jane Sanders, walked back to their hotel the morning of the final day of the Democratic National Convention. As they walked, supporters cheered: “This is what democracy looks like! Tell me what democracy looks like? This is what democracy looks like!”

“Thank you Bernie!,” some supporters said, as people driving by honked their horns in appreciation. Some supporters asked if they could get a selfie with him and other said, “You’re my hero Bernie, thank you!” One supporter yelled, “We need you! We need your movement!”

After Bernie and Jane went inside the hotel, the Facebook group Bernie Sanders Brigade interviewed one of his supporters, Noah, who had traveled all the way from California to protest and support Sanders. He had tears in his eyes and said seeing Bernie was bittersweet.

"The 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks has not been a moment for unity at Occidental College.On Saturday, the Occidental College Republican Club planted 2,997 small American flags to honor those killed in the terrorist attacks of 2001 (photo at right). In a Facebook posting, the Republican group said the memorial was intended to promote Sept. 11 as ""a day of respect and remembrance for all the victims and heroes of 9/11."" The memorial was registered with the college, which granted permission for the flags to be placed on campus.But by Sunday morning, many of the flags had been removed and placed in the trash, and others had their sticks broken.Fliers (at right) were placed on campus offering another message of Sept. 11: ""RIP the 2,996 Americans who died in 9/11. RIP the 1,455,590 innocent Iraqis who died during the U.S. invasion for something they didn't do.""Not surprisingly, differing interpretations are being offered of what happened.The Occidental Republicans said on Facebook that they guarded the remaining flags after they discovered the vandalism and prevented some students -- who arrived to snap the sticks with flags -- from doing more.The students are vowing to replant the flags. ""We ask that all students respect the memorial for the remainder of its time in the quad. If you try to destroy it, we will rebuild it,"" said a statement from the Republicans. The statement added that there was no reason to damage the memorial. ""This is beyond politics, this is about those lives that were so tragically taken.""But on the Facebook site of CODE, the Coalition for Diversity and Equity at Occidental, another view was offered.""On a campus that proclaims itself time and again to be diverse, equitable and safe for all of its students, the display of American flags covering the entire academic quad disproved that proclamation,"" the statement said. ""When we became aware of the purpose of this display, to memorialize 9/11, we were concerned by the complete disregard for the various peoples affected by this history. As students of color, this symbol of the American flag is particularly triggering for many different reasons. For us, this flag is a symbol of institutionalized violence (genocide, rape, slavery, colonialism, etc.) against people of color, domestically as well as globally. Additionally, if the goal of the memorial is to commemorate the lives lost during 9/11, the singular nature of the American flag fails to account for the diversity of lives lost on that day.""The statement noted that the group had added statements, poems and signs ""to broaden the memorial,"" but the statement did not comment directly on those who took down the flags.CODE also stated that the American flag cannot be viewed as something that means the same to all people, and it noted the refusal of some athletes to stand for the national anthem at sporting events -- something that is starting to happen at some college events.""Historically, the American flag and subsequent American nationalist symbols have been polarizing and marginalizing to people of color living within the United States. This has been most recently exemplified in Colin Kaepernick's protest of the American national anthem,"" said the statement.Occidental officials are vowing to investigate what happened to the flag memorial.Erica O'Neal Howard, acting dean of students, sent an email to the campus in which she confirmed that many flags had been removed and thrown in the trash. ""We don’t yet know who is responsible for this incident, but the college is investigating and will take appropriate disciplinary action,"" she said.Howard added, ""Freedom of speech is protected by the First Amendment. The right and freedom to debate complex, contentious issues and disagree with each other is fundamental to what we do at Oxy. At the same time, we may not express ourselves in ways that prevent others from engaging in protected speech. As the student handbook states, 'Occidental College imposes on students, faculty members, administrators and trustees an obligation to respect the dignity of others, to acknowledge their right to express differing opinions and to foster and defend intellectual honesty, freedom of inquiry and instruction, and free expression both on and off campus.'

Faith without prayer becomes ideology, Pope warns

October 17, 2013

Christians who do no pray risk descending into an ideological version of faith, Pope Francis warned a congregation at morning Mass on October 17. And when one becomes “a disciple of the ideology, he has lost the faith.”

Commenting on a Gospel in which Jesus denounced the Pharisees, the Pope spoke about the danger of a dry and unloving approach to faith. “The faith passes through a distiller, so to speak, and becomes ideology,” he said. Ideology “chases away the people,” the Pope said, and—like the Pharisees—imposes burdens on ordinary people that tend to distance them from the faith.

The Pope said that the influence of “ideological Christians” is a “serious illness” in the Church.

Speaking of Christians who make it difficult for others to enter the Church, Pope Francis said: “When we go down the street and find ourselves in front of a closed church, it feels strange.” There are reasons—or “excuses, justifications”—for keeping churches closed, he said, but the result is ‘the image of Christians who have the key in their hand, but take it away without opening the door.”

“The key that opens the door to faith is prayer,” the Pope said. A Christian who does not pray is an “arrogant witness,” likely to drive others away from the Church.

Again referring to the Pharisees, the Pope cautioned: “I say to pray. I do not say to ‘say prayers,’ because these teachers of the law said many prayers.”

The women gathered in a small circle. It was easier that way. Easier to do their work, easier to pass Destiny from one to another.

The Maiden Clotho — youngest of the sisters — sat at her spinning wheel spinning thread after thread. This was her piece. Birthing the thread. Pulling it forth from the chaos of The Mother Thread, skillfully wielding her spindle, forming one perfect, beautiful bit of fiber.

The Mother Lachesis — the middle sister — would take the spun thread and measure it out. Some threads were measured long. Others were shorter. Much shorter. Most were rough, although every so often a thread as smooth as silk would appear. She was diligent and conscientious in her allotments.

The Crone Atropos — eldest sister of the three — would cut the threads at the lengths determined by Lachesis. She used her shears to make sure each thread was incised at precisely the correct place in precisely the correct manner. She was responsible for the unturning of the thread and for sending it back to The Mother Thread for Clotho to spin again.",human,human-written

"(a) Tracking resources

Our results demonstrate that the consumption of CEW moths by Brazilian free-tailed bats tracks the abundance of these moths. While the seasonal patterns of moth abundance differ among the pheromone trap sites, they are significantly correlated at three of the four sites, and the numbers of bats consuming CEW moths are significantly associated with moth abundances at each of these same sites. At the fourth trap site (Uvalde) moth abundance was neither correlated with those at the other sites, nor associated with the numbers of bats consuming CEW moths. Our estimates of moth abundances combining data from the four sites are indicators of the distribution of CEW moth availability over the landscape. With regard to the use of this landscape by bats, the estimates based on the maximum numbers of moths captured consistently outperform the estimates based on the average numbers of moths captured in providing the closest associations with the numbers of bats consuming CEW moths (Table 3; Figure 3). This result is expected if bats forage at the locations where moths are most abundant, and is consistent with the hypothesis that the bats track moth abundance in space as well as time.

In contrast to the significant associations observed between the numbers of bats eating CEW and estimates of CEW moth abundance, the numbers of CEW gene sequences in the feces of bats show no associations with our estimates of moth abundance (Figure 4). There are many complications in relating gene copy numbers to estimates of biomass or numbers of prey consumed [14]. These complications include differences in the DNA content of different prey species, differences in digestive efficiencies and DNA content of different body parts of prey, possible variation in DNA content related to the age or life history stage of prey items, the age of the meal that produced the feces, and inherent variation in the PCR process [14]. Our captive feeding experiments show a positive relationship between the percent mass of CEW moths in a bat's meal and the numbers of CEW gene copies in resulting feces (Information S1; Table S1; Figure S1). However, feces from meals with a similar proportional CEW content often differed by orders of magnitude in numbers of gene copies (Table S1). In addition, the relationship between gene copy content of feces and the numbers of moths eaten was affected by what else a bat ate in the same meal. This is illustrated by the separate feedings of bat # 3 (Table S1) where the consumption of five moths comprising 100% of a meal yielded over 4 million gene copies per mg feces; whereas consumption of five moths comprising 26% of a meal yielded less than 200,000 gene copies per milligram. The occurrence of such variation in qPCR estimates, even in a comparatively simple captive feeding situation, demonstrates that our attempt to calibrate qPCR gene copy numbers to CEW consumption did not provide measures of the biomass or number of prey consumed. Given that a single Brazilian free-tailed bat typically consumes many different insect taxa in a single night [8], we suspect even greater variability in gene copy numbers from field samples. Our qPCR results are consistent with the assessment by King et al. [14] that estimates of gene copies obtained in field studies are likely to provide, at best, some semiquantitative measure of predation.

It is nonetheless of interest to investigate the gene copy data in the contexts of the seasonal patterns of CEW moth abundance and the frequency of moth consumption by bats. Our results illustrate two periods, one in spring (April–early May), and the other in mid-late summer (late July–September), when moths are rare and few bats are feeding on them. However, during spring gene copy numbers are low, whereas in mid-late summer, gene copy numbers are higher. Earlier research on the insect resource base and dietary breadth of Brazilian free-tailed bats has shown greater insect diversity and broader dietary breadth in spring than in late summer [7]. Earlier work on the seasonal life history and behavior of the bats also shows that in late summer they feed for longer periods, lose body mass, and appear to be under much greater food stress than in spring [33], [34] (GFM, pers. observation). Taken together, these observations and our qPCR data suggest that, to the bats that eat them, CEW moths are a more important part of their diet in mid-late summer than in spring.

With the spike in CEW moth abundance in mid-season (late May–mid July) and again with their abrupt increase during the fall migration of moths, the numbers of bats eating CEW increases, and the high frequency of consumption is often coupled with high gene copy numbers. This suggests that in mid-season during pregnancy and lactation and in fall prior to migration CEW moths are an important part of the diet of many bats.

All earlier studies investigating the diets of Brazilian free-tailed bats and links to agronomic impacts were confined to mid-season months, focusing on the arrival of migrating moths in late May–early June and subsequent infestations of crops into summer [5], [6], [8]. This is the same period that the bats must cope with high energetic demands associated with pregnancy and lactation [35]. The returning southward migrations of insects on advancing cold fronts has been well established by entomological researchers, and in fact, some of the highest densities of moths ever recorded aloft were observed in September [36]. However, because these late-season migrants do not have the same immediate regional agronomic impact, the migrations and population dynamics of insects in autumn have been less studied than those during spring and summer. Our data are the first to implicate the late season migrations of insects on advancing cold fronts as a resource during another period that is critical for the survival of the bats; the time when they must accumulate fat reserves for their migratory flight in advance of the approaching winter.",human,human-written
"After years of teasing and a major enterprise launch, Intel’s Optane memory is finally available for PCs and enthusiast systems. While it’s limited to Kaby Lake processors and 200-series motherboards, this launch of a fundamentally new type of memory should offer significant performance improvements in at least some workloads. Early reviews, however, don’t entirely bear that out.

Intel isn’t offering Optane as a full SSD option yet, but you can order 16GB or 32GB drives for $44 or $77 (MSRP). Intel supports these drives as cache options via Intel SRT (Smart Response Technology). This isn’t a new feature from Intel; SRT has been supported on small SSD cache drives for at least five years, and Intel’s Optane drives appear to offer commensurate benefits to an SSD cache drive when used in an equivalent configuration. Anandtech, Ars Technica, Hot Hardware, and Tech Report have all taken Optane out for a spin, with varying results.

Most of the early reviews on Optane are, at best, cautiously optimistic. Anandtech’s sample failed too quickly for them to be comfortable giving a final verdict, though they do note impressive performance improvements for small transfer sizes and low queue depths. In multiple cases, workloads on a conventional HDD + Optane were accelerated to SSD-equivalent levels. Windows boot times also shrank dramatically, at least once cache training had been performed (Hot Hardware has benchmarks that address this acceleration, specifically, one of which is shown below).

This mirrors what we’ve seen from other types of caching in the past. Re-running a workload multiple times trains the cache solution to expect that workload in the future.

Limited appeal

One issue no one’s happy with is Intel’s decision to limit Optane to Kaby Lake CPUs in 200-series chipsets. SSD caches (and Optane caches) would be most effective if deployed as acceleration in lower-cost systems or older hardware. Intel’s decision to sandbox their platform to only the latest motherboards and CPUs means the computers that could benefit the most from Optane acceleration aren’t eligible to use it.

It’s also telling the platforms Intel shipped for Optane testing literally preclude comparing it with its most logical competitor. As we’ve previously stated, Optane should be compared against SSD drive caching, but the B250 motherboards that Intel provided literally only support Optane caching. If you try to configure the software to cache via SSD instead, it refuses to do so. For that, you need a Z270 motherboard, and that’s one reason we don’t have Optane figures ourselves today. The appropriate configuration to test against is the configuration that should serve as Intel’s primary competitor.

But any comparison of SSD-versus-Optane pricing drives home that this isn’t 2012. Back then, it made sense to buy into SSD cache drives, particularly if you wanted to add SSD-like performance to an existing rig without giving up the much larger capacities of a hard drive. Today, SSD prices have fallen so much that you can buy a 256GB SSD for the same cost as a 32GB Optane cache (~$77). While we aren’t claiming that the performance benefits of an SSD cache are equivalent or exactly matched to those of an Optane cache, look through the slideshow from our 2012 review against any of the reviews above, and you’ll see many of the same performance improvements — with the aforementioned exception of Optane’s low queue depth performance, which really is exceptional compared with SSDs.

SSD cache drives have found limited adoption in low-end desktops and laptops, but the higher power consumption of Optane when in standby (it consumes roughly 1W compared to ~.1W for SSDs) may make it a non-starter in the mobile market. SSD prices may rise this year, so Optane caches may become more compelling, but it’s unclear there’s a great consumer performance argument here just yet.

In and of itself, this isn’t really a problem. It’s easy to forget now, but when the first consumer SSDs began to hit the market, they didn’t exactly cover themselves in glory, either. The earliest SSDs were ludicrously expensive, tiny, and couldn’t even match spinning magnetic media on certain workloads due to poor random read/write performance. Optane clearly has data center capabilities and superior consumer performance may arrive with future generations. But as of today, we agree with Ars Technica’s Peter Bright, who writes:

Rather than showcasing the new capabilities that 3D XPoint brings to the table, it simply highlights how wretched Intel’s product segmentation is. It’s at best an incremental improvement over SRT, and for the money, most people are probably going to be better off with a plain flash SSD than a hybrid disk anyway. 3D XPoint may yet turn out to be something good, perhaps even something world-changing. But this ain’t it.

Not everyone calls Optane out quite that harshly — Hot Hardware allows that the caching solution “may make sense” in certain configurations, but virtually all of the review coverage agrees that limited storage options and Intel’s segmentation decisions sharply limit Optane’s addressable market. Intel’s decision to ship a test platform that prohibited the most logical comparison point to make against its own hardware also doesn’t say much for the company’s confidence in its own performance.

"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

The California state Senate voted 28-8 Wednesday to exempt itself from the pointless gun-control laws that apply to the rest of the populace. Legislators apparently think they alone are worthy to pack heat on the streets for personal protection, and the masses ought to wait until the police arrive.

This is just one of many bills Golden State politicians used this legislative session to set themselves apart from the little people, the ones who pay their inflated salaries. Annual compensation for legislators averages about $140,000, not counting luxurious perks such as taxpayer-funded cars and free gasoline. By comparison, the average Californian earns $50,000 a year, and the unemployment rate is 11.9 percent - far above the national average. Exact salaries for state assemblymen and senators are obscured by the use of a “per diem” payment scheme that shelters a significant chunk of income from taxation.

Attempts by a handful of reformers to require politicians to provide a full annual disclosure of the benefits received from the public treasury have been rebuffed. Currently, government officials must file a statement of economic interests revealing income from any source other than a local, state or federal government agency. Gifts worth more than $50 also must be disclosed, but lawmakers rejected a bill that would have prohibited acceptance of concert and sporting event tickets, gift cards, spa treatments, golf outings and other benefits from lobbyists trying to buy votes.

Bills of this nature never meet an honest fate in which roll-call votes put members on the record as favoring or opposing each idea. Instead, reform measures are held in committee to die quietly as legislative deadlines pass. As of last week, it’s effectively impossible for a bill to become law if it hasn’t already passed in at least one of the chambers.

Such a silent death sentence was imposed on a bill that would have eliminated the practice of allowing select public employees to avoid paying red-light-camera tickets and escape any consequence for using toll roads without paying. The current system grants free rides to politicians, court workers, police officers, city council members, social workers, meter maids and their spouses. The bill failed even after a compromise amendment deleted the requirement to pay red-light-camera tickets.

The arrogance of the political class is certainly not limited to California. Federal law prohibits private companies from pestering the public with unwanted telemarketing calls from businesses, but Congress exempted “political organizations” - i.e., themselves - from its provisions. In Sacramento, an attempt failed to establish a special Do Not Call list for people who don’t want to listen to automated calls from California pols.

Left coast politicians lack all shame regarding their self-enrichment at public expense. Even though their outrageous conduct has sunk a once-prosperous state $10 billion in debt, the public seems not to care. In November, voters recycled Jerry Brown as governor even though Gov. Moonbeam’s disastrous tenure during the 1970s enabled the compensation packages for a unionized public sector that are busting the budget today. When California finally goes bankrupt, voters need only look in the mirror when wondering who deserves the blame.",human,human-written
"Do you know the backstory of that new tee?

There was a time when shopping was a rare and exciting activity. Now, it is a hobby. Fashion brands are always looking ahead, designing clothes to meet the demands of fast fashion. But we need to look further ahead because the environment is suffering because of every single piece of clothing we buy on a whim.

In the trade-off between fashion and the environment, the mass is choosing the former. That has to change. Often, even people concerned about the environment and human rights fail to realize how significant the share of fashion is in environmental degradation and exploitation of labor.

The high-end fashion brands that we adore are exploiting labor in order to keep up with ‘fast-fashion’. That is how they are able to amass huge profits while staying in the fashion game. Workers have reported ‘slave-like’ conditions at international fashion giants like Zara, H&M and Primark. Women, men, and children in countries like Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, and India are employed by these big fashion labels for producing clothes at the lowest cost possible. They sometimes work for over 16 hours a day and get a meagre wage of around 13 dollars per month, which is barely enough for sustenance.

Have you ever wondered about the environmental impact of that plain cotton tee hanging in your wardrobe? Probably not. For starters, it takes about 2700 liters of water to produce the cotton for a single t-shirt. That’s enough to fill 22 bathtubs, or to sustain a human for almost 900 days! Its carbon footprint is nearly 7 kilograms.

Given that an average human buys 20 pieces of clothing every year, the cost the environment (and community) pays for our fashion is enormous. It is imperative that we reuse what we have, and resist the urge to buy more.

There will always be some new outfit that we wish we could have. But there’s only one earth. Degrading it in the process of buying what we want but don’t need, promotes not only pollution but also unethical and unfavorable working conditions for workers. As consumers, and as citizens of this planet, we need to make wiser decisions.

In a nutshell, here’s how you can do your bit for the environment -

Don’t trash your clothes, donate them. You’d be helping the community and the earth. (it’s a win-win) Choose sustainable brands which use natural fabrics like hemp instead of synthetics like polyester (which harm us by entering the water supply and food chain) Choose slow and sustainable fashion, or green fashion, instead of fast fashion. Slow fashion consists of clothing that lasts several years, as compared to fast fashion, in which cheap and new clothes are introduced each micro-season (which can be as many as 52 a year!). Please repeat outfits. It’s NOT uncool. (trashing the environment is)

We can save the environment, one t-shirt at a time!",human,human-written
"Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman is an American patriot. Having been awarded the Purple Heart is a testament to his courage on the battlefield.

As a 21-year veteran of the U.S. Army, I thank him for his service.

As an American, I applaud his courage to comply with a lawful subpoena and testify truthfully before Congress about his knowledge of President Trump’s “perfect call” with the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky.

During his testimony, he told his dad “not to worry” because this was America. But as soon as President Trump was acquitted by the GOP-led Senate, Lt. Col. Vindman was summarily fired from the White House, along with his twin brother who had no involvement with the impeachment.

We’ve since learned that the White House directed the Secretary of Defense and the Department of the Army to “dig up dirt” on Lt. Col. Vindman so he could be fired. Try as they might, their efforts were fruitless.

As it turned out, Lt. Col. Vindman was unimpeachable.

On July 8th Lt. Col. Vindman submitted his request for resignation from the Army.

His attorney cited a campaign of “bullying, intimidation, and retaliation” by President Trump and his administration as the reason for Vindman’s resignation. He knew his career was over.",human,human-written
"Our journey began in 2014 and the majority of our projects were close to our expertise (social media marketing) and they were not putting us often out of our comfort zone. I don’t know if this was a good thing or not, but I have to admit that I enjoyed 2018 more than every other year before.

In a nutshell, 2018 was full of challenges:

We started a new department.

We grew our team.

We focused on video production.

We didn’t do things as good as we wanted to.

Looking back, I am very proud of our team, our clients, our partners & the results we managed to deliver in 2018. Congrats everyone! PS. Yes, we will do even better in 2019.

We started a new department

We have only been working on digital projects since the day we were founded. Call it social media marketing, website design & development, newsletter marketing or mobile app design & development, all our projects were about digital marketing. Nonetheless, communication should not and cannot be only in digital form. Real life experiences are much more memorable and can actually create feelings. As Maya Angelou said,

I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.

So, we had to start creating more feelings. And we did, by creating our own, in-house PR department. In July, we signed our 2 first clients: VANS & Eastpak.

Only a couple of months later, we did organise our very first event: The launch of Raf Simons x Eastpak collection in Greece. I can’t even describe how much anxious I was the days before. Long story short, the event was a huge success.

The Challenge

Starting a new department in our company has never been easy. Actually, it has been a terrifying process as we are stepping out of our comfort zone and we are getting into something completely new. As much terrifying it might be, it is equally exciting!

We decided to join the PR-bandwagon for a couple of reasons:

influencer marketing has been very close to digital marketing and even closer to YouTube content production (more on this, later)

the most viral videos online derive from offline content and, if we want to make great online content, we have to make great offline activations

digital should not act on its own; digital is part of a wider strategy where offline activations are equally important

our clients were asking us for this type of services

Of course, the PR department wouldn’t have been true without adding new members in our team.

We grew our team

Dora Papakonstantopoulou joined us in July as Communications & PR Strategist. After 8 years in PR agencies, Dora took the leap of faith and decided to join us by heading jetdrops’ PR department.

Her role in signing and running VANS & Eastpak has been crucial but her impact in the team has been even more significant as she brought in a different mindset.

A few months earlier, in March, Angelianna Prevezanou joined jetdrops as a Project Manager. Now, she holds a dual role, both as Project Manager and as Communications Specialist working closely with Dora in the PR department.

Angelianna’s commitment to delivering the project under all circumstances and her persistence made her a perfect fit for our team since day one while her curiosity has helped us to think out of the box.

The Challenge

Hiring new people has always been difficult for us. None of us has any HR background and we don’t have any solid internal procedures for hiring. When hiring a new person, we mainly focus on cultural fit. We want each new team member to be psyched to join jetdrops. Potential hires usually meet the majority of the team and we only make an offer when we are sure that there is a perfect match. It does not always work the way we want it to, but we are trying to minimise the turnover because, as in all small companies, people turnover hurts us the most.

Thus selecting a new team member is always a long lasting procedure in order to minimise the potential risk. Angelianna and Dora were not different as we had numerous & extensive conversations before having them on board!

We focused on video production

In Greece, when marketeers are asked to describe Social Media they respond mostly with Facebook & Instagram. We do love both of these platforms: Everyone is on Facebook while Instagram is the feel-good network for users.

However, both of them have a great disadvantage: they are not the first priority of the user. You might watch the latest Instagram stories of your friends while walking to your office or you might scroll through Facebook when watching TV. It is not very often that you solely focus on Facebook or Instagram.

On the other hand, if you open YouTube you have decided that you will wear your headphones and you will actually watch a video there. Branded experiences in YouTube are much more effective compared to Instagram & Facebook. Users in YouTube spend numerous seconds (if not minutes) watching a specific video while they only spend a second or two viewing a Facebook or Instagram post.

This is the reason we shifted our focus to video production. Currently, jetdrops is responsible for the YouTube content of Vodafone CU while we closely work with Anna Maria Velli, one of the most influential Greek YouTubers with more than 240.000 subscribers. Moreover, in 2018 we worked with Wolt on their launch video for the Greek market.

The Challenge

YouTube content production in Greece has not been very popular amongst marketeers mainly due to its high cost, compared to Facebook & Instagram content. However, we are confident that over the next couple of years, YouTube will be extremely hot and everyone will be doing it.

So, in order to be ahead of our competition, we had to read a lot of articles, watch tons of videos from Greek & international creators and experiment even more! Actually, we are still doing it.

We didn’t do things as good as we wanted to

During 2018 we faced numerous challenges; others were related to the projects and others were related to our operating model.

Growing up is not easy.

Dealing with these challenges resulted in not doing some things as good as we would like to.

Although we launched jetdrops’ Facebook page, we haven’t posted any content.

Although we posted some content in jetdrops’ Instagram account, we didn’t post as much as we would like to.

Although we posted 16 articles in jetdrops’ medium account in 2017, we only posted 1 in 2018.

We didn’t make as many proactive suggestions as we would like to to our existing clients.

We didn’t promote jetdrops at all; and it’s a shame.

We didn’t celebrate.

We didn’t work on any cool, refreshing & owned projects.

2019 Resolutions

So, this year we have to make things better and that’s why we will set specific targets.

Celebrate our successes. Post at least once per week in our Facebook account. Post at least once per week in our Instagram account. Write 20 articles in our medium account. Launch at least 2 owned projects. Make our people, clients & partners happier!

In early 2020, we will come back to this article and see how many of these resolutions will have been met. Fingers crossed, we will have made 6/6.

Spoiler alert: We did visualise this article in our instagram account; it’s dope!

"Beyond This Moment

Photo by Amparo Michel on Unsplash

The space between lines

is thin.

The race between time

is won, when

winners realize

time is faster than them.

We’ll never catch up;

time is faster than wind.

And if we ever catch up

that’s when time will end.

Let real life begin,

and reality will blend

with now.

And this moment will finally

be found.

And this moment will finally

be still.

But until

this moment is finally hours

with no minutes;

and ours

with no limits;

and ours

with no endings.

Only beginnings.

Only extending.

Only upending

all we once knew,

but have quickly forgotten.

All we pursue

that’s been useful for nothing.

Be in this moment

before beyond this moment

is now.

"Great souls appear to be missing today

No inspiring leaders for just human causes

None with the stature of Mahatma Gandhi

Or unshakeable moral character like MLK

Political integrity of RFK or John McCain.

Our world could use some great souls now

To set an example of what’s right and just

Inspiring human causes for our greater good

Initiating new golden era of human rights

Breaking centuries racist barriers lingering.

Until some great soul appears on the scene

We should look to our own inner consciences

To understand what contributions, we can make

In creating equal opportunities for everyone

Helping freedom’s bell to ring loud and true.

Human rights, society’s perpetual challenge

Destroying prejudices so long in existence

Making progress towards equal justice for all,

Looking deeply into our own great souls.",human,human-written
